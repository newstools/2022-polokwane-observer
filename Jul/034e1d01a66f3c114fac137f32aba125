POLOKWANE – These squash-related terms will hopefully soon be part of residents’ vocabulary with the addition of the Polokwane High Performance (PHP) Squash Club. The club, which was founded last year, hosted a tournament at the Peter Mokaba Sports Complex on June 16. PHP Squash Club chairman Emmanuel Musefwe explained the tournament was held to raise awareness on the existence of the squash club. “The tournament was our way of reaching out to people who may be interested in joining the club. Squash is one of the best sports to take part in to improve your health. We want to get more black people to take an interest in the sport,” he said.      Players from across the province took part in the tournament and showed off their squash skills. Musefwe said PHP is focused on developmental programmes and getting children involved in the sport as they feel there are a lot of opportunities in squash. “We would like people to know that the game of squash is available in Polokwane as, unfortunately, a lot of people don’t know about the sport. The sport is easily accessible,” he added. Musefwe shared that squash contributes towards a child’s development, both mentally and physically. Interested people can visit their social media platforms by searching Polokwane High Performance Squash Club.
