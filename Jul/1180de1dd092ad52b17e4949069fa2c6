Finding the correct bicycle size for your child is critical. A badly fitted bicycle can cause pain when riding, making cycling a miserable experience for any child. While wheel size is how bicycle manufacturers categorise children’s bicycle sizes, it is not the sole criteria. A child’s age is also not a reliable predictor of size. So, how should a child’s bicycle size be determined? Finding the right size bicycle for your child is quick and easy with our simple tips. The best indicator of which size is appropriate for your child is how at ease they are riding the bike. It’s always better to have your child try several bicycles to get the greatest fit. Let them sit on the seat, grasp the handlebars, test the brakes, and ride the bicycle to ensure that it fits. A knowledgeable bicycle sales employee at your local bicycle shop may provide you with personalised fit advice. When shopping for children’s bicycles, keep in mind that, unlike adult bicycles, they are measured by the size of the wheel rather than the frame. The most typical children’s bicycles have 12″ wheels and go up to 24″ wheels. Following that, older children can select among adult-sized bicycles, which begin with 26″ wheels. However, wheel size is only one factor to consider while shopping for a children’s bicycle. When your child is testing a new bicycle, keep the following three things in mind: Mountain bicycles for children often have larger, knobblier tyres and may have front shocks, which are meant to ease the impact of rocky terrain by compressing and rebounding and can aid in overall stability. They’re ideal for children who want to cycle trails or harder terrain. Good to know: When a child is initially learning how to ride a bicycle, the seat should be low enough for them to contact the ground with both feet to stop and catch themselves if they fall. As they improve, you’ll want them to be more on their tiptoes so they can bike more effectively while still being kind on their knees.
