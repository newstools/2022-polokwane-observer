The one-of-a-kind wilderness adventure route for the internationally acclaimed 2022 Nedbank Tour deTuli mountain bike tour taking place from 19 – 24 July has been released – and it’s wild! Traversing three countries – South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana – the exclusive tour will start and end at the World Heritage Site in South Africa and take riders through two protected wilderness areas – the Northern Tuli Game Reserve, in Botswana, and the multi-country Mapungubwe National Park. In keeping with its 16-year tradition, the riders generally follow ancient elephant trails and rural tracks, creating the opportunity to experience cultural interactions with villagers, while also spotting wildlife against the backdrop of Africa’s unspoiled natural wilderness – a once-in-a-lifetime bucket list journey. Riders cover about 300 km of mountain biking trails which will be split up over four days covering between 60 km and 85 km per day.  All funds raised by the Tour de Tuli are channeled into the Children in the Wilderness (CITW) programme – a non-profit partner, which focuses on sustainable conservation through leadership development and education of rural children in Africa. The tour has raised over R20 million in the last 15 years, which allowed over 5600 children to be hosted in the CITW camp programme and over 11 000 children in the Eco-Club programme. The event follows strict environmental practices, working with communities and crossing through unforgettable routes, allowing riders to fully immerse themselves in their amazing wilderness surroundings.
