Winter is hard on hair, so give it some extra TLC and all the right products to make your hair look and feel gorgeous, healthy and hydrated during the colder months. Nativechild shares some insider tips on what to do to help your natural hair live its best life this winter: There is no need to shampoo your hair more than twice a week during winter, unless you feel you really need to, as less shampooing means less stripping the hair of its natural oils. You can co-wash (conditioner wash) your hair instead. Wash day must start with a moisturising shampoo, followed by deep conditioning.  Use a hair mist spray on the days you skip wash day to start your moisturising process.  Follow the right moisture method for your hair. The right one is one that leaves your hair soft and manageable. Liquid Oil Cream / Liquid Cream Oil / Liquid Oil / Liquid Cream are methods of retaining moisture which will help keep hair moisturised for longer helping to retain length. Make sure your hair is fully hydrated before applying the oils.  Your scalp is the garden from where your hair sprouts from. You must ensure it is clean, hydrated, and nourished. Do regular massages to circulate blood. Castor oil is the best to keep your hair fully moisturised and healthy. Section your hair and apply oils from the scalp, taking care of the roots of the hair.  Knotless braids, or any plaits that tuck away ends using your own hair (no extensions) are perfect for the winter months. Before deciding on your desired look, do a deep condition to add an extra level of moisture. Some hairstyles that are easy to manage or wear under a wig are cornrows and flat twists. Maintain the moisture by spraying a hair hydrating mist daily. Be sure not to keep your hair braided for too long, to avoid the risk of a receding hairline.  Eat your greens and hydrate your body. Hair comes from within and is a sign of vitality. No amount of product can make up for a poor diet. An integrated approach is best.
