POLOKWANE – He was elected as the president at the club’s annual general meeting which was held at the Polokwane Golf Club recently. Maswanganyi is excited by the challenge that awaits. “Many clubs look up to Sapa Yopa and I am honoured to lead this great club. Sapa Yopa is a very big brand and there is much to be done and to be rectified. We will continue to live our dream of cultural diversity with a membership that includes various cultural groups,” he said. Maswanganyi added that the club needs to put in more effort to assist those in need. “We need to be more visible and assist with food parcels and sanitary towels,” he said. The new president noted that the club will remain firm in its roots. “We are a social- and charity-oriented group of people who love to ride motorcycles and enjoy the scenic views of our beautiful continent. “The club is built on brotherhood and respect, not only among ourselves but for other road users as well.” He said his most important role will be to oversee that the annual rally is delivered according to the standard of Sapa Yopa. “I have been involved in Sapa Yopa for many years, and I have learnt to understand the club’s culture and the challenges that come with the leadership position. I hope to establish a Sapa Yopa clothing line which will financially benefit the club and also create employment. The profit will be used to run our charity programme,” Maswanganyi explained. Outgoing president Antonio ‘Pico Santana’ Martins, who took the helm in 2021, wished Maswanganyi the best of luck. “We should not fight for the position, but rather allow the position to be shared with others. We are all behind the newly elected president. As the former leader, I think we should stand and support him and make sure that he delivers. I trust the newly elected executive committee will deliver and be able to do what is needed for the club,” said Martins.
