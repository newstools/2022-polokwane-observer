We’ve heard about blue light protection lenses, variable tint glasses and the like – but do you actually need these upgrades and, if so, how do you know what is right for your eyes? We’ve got the low-down on the latest, must-have lens upgrades to give your eyes the best comfort and vision possible with these commonly asked Q&A’s from Spec-Savers:  Bad blue light: Harmful blue-violet light has been identified as the most dangerous and significant levels of blue light is produced by computer, smartphone, tablet and other digital device screens.  The amount they emit is only a fraction of that in sunlight, but the amount of time people spend using these devices and the proximity of these screens to the user’s face have optometrists concerned. Why? Because this exposure, over time, potentially accelerates retinal aeing and may cause serious long-term damage to your retina. This is because while our eyes are very effective at blocking UV rays from reaching the light-sensitive retina at the back of the eyeball, virtually all visible blue light passes through the cornea and lens and reaches the retina.
The verdict: If you spend a lot of time looking at screens, It is recommended to use blue light protection lenses, as they greatly reduce the amount of blue light reaching your eyes without affecting the visibility of the display.
