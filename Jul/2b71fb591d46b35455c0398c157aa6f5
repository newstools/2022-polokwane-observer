POLOKWANE – The Nirvana Premier League (NPL) is back with a bang. An opening ceremony for the second instalment of the tournament was recently held at the Nirvana cricket field, and local cricket enthusiasts came out in their numbers to support. NPL CEO Faizul Ramdala and managing director Huzefa Patel Surti said they started the league to get the Nirvana community involved in cricket. “We decided to host a formal league tournament in our neighbourhood in the hopes that everyone would join forces and enjoy the matches.” According to Ramdala, children are involved in the matches to teach them how to nurture the spirit of unity through cricket. Surti added that this season was the first one that had an opening ceremony. “We intend to make the opening ceremonies a yearly occasion in order to appreciate the effort players put in each match,” he explained. The NPL will be contested for by 10 teams who have been equally divided into two groups. The Nawabs and Knight Riders are joined by the Burgersfort Tigers, Hansoty Kings and Bumaliya Smashers XI in group A. Group B consists of Pocha Lions, Bangladesh Tigers XI, Nirvana Royal Challengers, Makanye Sultans and Miyaan Warriors. Matches are played on Sundays and three matches have thus far been played this season. The Nawabs, Sultans and the Lions were victorious in their respective matches, but there is a long way to go before the season concludes in September.
