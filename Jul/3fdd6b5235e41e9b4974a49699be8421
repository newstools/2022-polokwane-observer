Serves 4 You’ll need: For the dough – 2 cups flour; 1 sachet of yeast; a pinch of salt; 1 cup warm water; 30ml melted butter For the chicken – 3 x skinless chicken breasts, sliced; salt and pepper; 30ml olive oil; ½ cup BBQ sauce; a handful of fresh basil, chopped (plus extra for serving); 30ml tomato paste; ½ punnet of cocktail tomatoes; 2 cups grated mozzarella or cheddar cheese; 1 avocado, sliced How to: Dough: Preheat the oven to 180 °C. Combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add the melted butter with water and mix to form a soft dough. Knead the dough for 5 minutes and place in an oiled bowl, cover with cling film and leave to rise for 1 hour. Chicken: Season chicken generously with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large pan and fry the chicken for about 3-5 minutes. Add the BBQ sauce and basil, then stir to coat the chicken evenly. Cook for a further 3-5 minutes or until cooked through and sticky. Set aside. Assemble: Place dough onto a floured surface. Using your fingers, press dough into a greased 25cm cast iron skillet or an ovenproof dish. Cover the base with tomato paste and top with the chicken mixture. Bake for 15-20 minutes before you remove it from the oven. Sprinkle the pizza with tomatoes and cheese and bake for another 10-12 minutes or until cooked through and the cheese has melted. Top off your dish with avocado and fresh basil just before you serve this tasty delight! Cook’s note: Roll out the pizza dough and bake on a baking tray if you don’t have a cast-iron skillet. *Recipe and image by www.astralchicken.com
