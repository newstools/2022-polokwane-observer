“We’re bringing the SuperVan into the 21st century with 1 470kW of all-electric power for unmatched excitement and unmistakable styling inspired by the new E-Transit Custom. But performance isn’t all about horsepower – the Electric SuperVan’s processing power means engineers can use real-time vehicle data to optimise its performance, just like on a top-level racing car,” said Mark Rushbrook, global director, Ford Performance Motorsports. Ford’s first SuperVan was revealed in 1971 and featured a mid-mounted engine taken from the Le Mans-winning Ford GT40 to create a Transit Mk 1 unlike any other. The formula was taken further for SuperVan 2; a glass fibre version of the Transit Mk 2 body was draped over the monocoque and 411kW Cosworth V8 of Ford’s C100 racing car. This vehicle was later reborn as the facelifted Transit Mk 3 lookalike SuperVan 3, powered by a screaming 650 PS Cosworth HB engine shared with Formula 1 cars of the era. “Ford Pro is all about accelerating productivity for our customers – so why not create a new Electric SuperVan that proves the power of electrification and connectivity?” said Hans Schep, general manager, Ford Pro, Europe. “This incredible demonstrator vehicle takes E-Transit Custom’s advanced engineering and distinctive look to a whole new level, and is high-speed proof of the power of Ford Pro’s connected services ecosystem.”  Turning E-Transit Custom up to 11 “The chance to be part of the iconic SuperVan story and reimagine what it could be in the 21st century was a dream opportunity,” said Amko Leenarts, director of design, Ford of Europe. “The fourth chapter of the SuperVan story is designed to be the fastest and most extreme, yet while keeping the Transit DNA. The proportions are a more dramatic version of what we developed for the E-Transit Custom and the front light bar creates a futuristic expression, making the Electric SuperVan the absolute pinnacle of Transit design language.” The demonstrator vehicle’s motorsport-spec construction marries the E-Transit Custom floorpan with a steel space frame and lightweight composite body panels. A bespoke 50kWh liquid-cooled battery pack is mounted for optimum weight distribution and a low centre of gravity, and can be fully recharged in approximately 45 minutes using a standard electric vehicle fast-charger. The driver can access charging and battery insights via the in-cab touchscreen. Four electric motors together deliver approximately 1 470kW through an all-wheel drive system – enough to propel the incredible van to 100km/h in under two seconds and making it comfortably the fastest SuperVan ever, as well as the cleanest. Like any good van, the Electric SuperVan features a loadspace behind the driver; a door in the bodyside makes loading and unloading cargo easy, and Ford is developing a secure electromagnetic release system controlled via the Sync screen.  A suite of onboard cameras can immerse audiences around the world in the action during SuperVan’s impressive high-performance runs. As on the Ford E-Transit, the driver can pull camera feeds onto the in-cab screen and switch between them to help position the vehicle. Ford Performance and Stard’s motorsport input is immediately obvious. The Ford Pro Electric SuperVan’s interior includes a full roll cage and racing seats to FIA standards for safety, as well as a large Sync touchscreen taken directly from Ford’s production vehicles, such as the Ford Mustang Mach-E 6 controlling the advanced connectivity and information systems. If required, drivers can take a break from hustling the Electric SuperVan up hill climbs and around racetracks to plot a route, find a charger, connect to Wi-Fi and make phone calls – all via the Sync screen. The touchscreen also enables control of the selectable drive modes that tailor the Electric SuperVan’s torque maps, regenerative braking and control responses to suit different driving scenarios:
• Road – for rare cases of “normal” driving
• Track – for balancing speed and cornering on track with racing slick tyres
• Drag – for maximum acceleration on drag strips while using drag racing radial tyres
• Drift – for spectacular drifting, agility demonstrations and snow driving
• Rally – for optimum performance on tarmac and gravel rally stages with special tyres  Further performance fine-tuning is delivered by an electronics package that includes traction control, launch control, a pit-lane speed limiter and three-stage regenerative braking to return energy to the battery – similar to the L Mode function on E-Transit. At low speed, ECO Mode keeps the motors at optimal efficiency, turns the regenerative braking up to maximum and cuts drive to the rear axle. For maximum speed, an E-Boost button puts a temporary power and torque boost at the driver’s fingertips. Watch the video on Ford Pro Electric SuperVan Source: QuickPic
