Serves 8 You’ll need:
2 onions, diced; 4 garlic cloves, minced; 2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar; 1 Tbsp miso paste; 2 Tbsp tomato paste; 500g Portabella mushroom steaks; 500g Portabellini mushrooms, quartered; 50g flour; 500ml vegetable stock; 2 x 400g tins kidney beans, drained and rinsed; 1 x 400g roll store bought puff pastry; 1 large egg, beaten, for egg wash; olive oil; salt and pepper, to taste How to: Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large saucepan. Brown the mushrooms in batches until golden brown all over. Remove from the pan and set aside. Add a fresh drizzle of oil to the pan. Sauté the onion until tender. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant. Add the balsamic vinegar, miso paste, and tomato paste and cook until the tomato paste turns a dark brick red colour. Add in the golden-brown mushrooms and scatter with flour. Mix well so everything is coated in the flour. Pour in the vegetable stock, mixing as you go to create a homogenous gravy. Add the kidney beans and bring to a simmer. Simmer until thickened and the flavours meld together. Taste to adjust seasoning. Preheat the oven to 200°C. Scrape the filling into a ± 22cm x 30cm baking dish. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the pastry to fit your baking dish. Cover the filling with the puff pastry and press down along the edges of the baking dish to seal the pie. Make 4 little slits in the pastry for steam to escape. Brush generously with egg wash and then place in the oven. Bake for 30-35 minutes until the crust is golden brown and cooked through. Serve generous spoonfuls with a fresh side salad and enjoy! *Recipe and image by the South African Mushroom Farmers’ Association.
