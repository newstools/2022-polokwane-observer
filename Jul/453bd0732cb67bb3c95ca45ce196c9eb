POLOKWANE – Avid runner and member of Mzansi Athletics Club in Polokwane, Mashudu Mavhundu, will make her debut at this year’s Comrades Marathon scheduled for August in Durban. The 41-year-old mom of three will join other novices from various clubs in the country, as well as seasoned marathon runners, who hope to stamp their names in the history books. Mavhundu joined the Mzansi Athletics Club in 2018 and soon one of her goals became to run the Comrades. “A big motivation to join the club was to become fit. It is difficult to maintain a certain body shape as a mom, but the club helped me to achieve my goals. I started to consider running the Comrades in 2020, but at that time I could not participate due to Covid-19.” Mavhundu said she is excited to see her Comrades dream realised. “I am excited and nervous at the same time. I don’t know what to expect at the marathon, but I hope to finish under 11 hours. I have prepared and trained well for the event. I run 10 kilometres a day with my club mates and we motivate each other. It is not easy because I am a mom, which means I have a lot of other responsibilities as well, but I want to see myself complete the race in August.”
