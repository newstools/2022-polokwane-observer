Serves 4 You’ll need: 500g Greek-style lamb sausages; 1 large onion, finely sliced; 4 hamburger buns, halved and toasted; 60ml Hummus, store-bought; 2 small avocados, peeled and stoned; salad leaves or butter lettuce; 2 ripe tomatoes, sliced; Tzatziki, store-bought How to: Remove the lamb sausage meat from the casing, discard the casings, and divide the meat into four equal portions. Roll the lamb sausage meat into patties and flatten slightly. Preheat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and gently cook the lamb patties until golden brown and cooked through. Set aside and keep warm. In the same frying pan, don’t wipe the pan out, add the onions and sauté until golden brown. To assemble, spread a tablespoon of hummus onto each hamburger bun, and top with lettuce and tomato, and a dollop of tzatziki, followed by the lamb patties and top with mashed avocado and the fried onion. *Recipe & image by SA Avocado Growers Association.
