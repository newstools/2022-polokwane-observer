POLOKWANE – Smythe said he was inspired by his parents, the late Ian and Silvia Smythe, who loved trees. “Not only do trees look good, they are also beneficial to us and our natural environment. We need to start taking the role trees play in our community seriously,” he said. There are many benefits that come with trees, such as climate control because they moderate the effects of the sun, rain and wind. So far, Smythe and his team planted a total of 175 trees and want to plant many more. He requests assistance in the form of donations of trees to grow this project even further. “So far, the tree planting project has been organised privately and paid out of my own pocket. We ask that people donate indigenous trees, because they adapt and survive environmental stresses better than exotic species. We would appreciate trees species such as Schotia brachypitala, Acacia Galpinii, Celtis Africana, Dovyalis caffra, Combretum Kraussii, Sclerocarya birrea and Kirkia Acuminata,” he said. He thanked everyone who have been part of the project and expressed gratitude toward Gert Rautenbach and Lizelle van der Westhuizen from GLG Construction, who provided the machinery to dig 109 holes from Dalmada Storage to the four-way stop. Van der Westhuizen said GLG Construction got onboard with the project as they appreciate the importance of trees. “The trees also make the area look beautiful,” she said.
