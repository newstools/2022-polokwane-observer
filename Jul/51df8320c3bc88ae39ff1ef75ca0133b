Serves 4 You’ll need: For the chicken – 2 cups buttermilk; 4 garlic cloves, chopped; 2 Tbsp paprika; 10-piece chicken braai pack; 1½ cups cake flour; 2 tsp garlic powder; 2 tsp dried herbs (oregano, thyme, or coriander); vegetable oil; salt and pepper For the sauce – 2 Tbsp sesame oil; 4 garlic cloves, sliced; 1 Tbsp ginger, grated; 1 red chilli, deseeded and chopped; 2 lemongrass stalks, chopped (optional); ½ cup soy sauce; ½ cup water; ¾ cup dark brown sugar; ¼ cup rice wine vinegar; ¼ cup tomato sauce For the salsa – ½ red onion, chopped; a handful of cocktail tomatoes, quartered; ¼ cucumber, chopped; a glug of olive oil; a squeeze of lemon juice How to: Combine the buttermilk, garlic, paprika, and chicken in a large bowl. Season and marinate overnight, if possible. Combine flour, garlic powder, and herbs. Season well. Add ¼ cup (60ml) of marinade mixture to the flour mixture and combine. Use a fork to create large flakes. Dip each chicken piece in flour mixture, coating evenly. Set aside. Heat oil in a large pot or work. Deep-fry the chicken in oil for about 7-8 minutes or until cooked through and golden. Drain on a paper towel. For the sauce, heat the sesame oil in a pot. Fry the garlic, ginger, lemongrass, and chilli for 2 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients. Simmer gently for about 8-10 minutes or until reduced and sticky. Combine salsa ingredients, season well, and set aside. Serve the fried chicken drizzled with the Asian sauce. Top with tomato salsa, fresh herbs, and lime wedges. Cook’s note: This marinade and crumb also work on chicken strips, thighs, and drumsticks. *Recipe and image by www.astralchicken.com
