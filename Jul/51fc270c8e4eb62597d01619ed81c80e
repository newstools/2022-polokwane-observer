POLOKWANE – The increasing high cost of living that has come as a result of rising fuel costs and other basic needs prices has left many South Africans resorting to inexpensive ways to get by. This includes transportation with people choosing to use public transport instead. Taxi associations have equally been feeling the burn and have had to increase their fares as a result.

A communique began circulating today (July 18) with the association citing a rise in fuel and car repair prices as a reason for the increase. All trips between the Indian Center to Mall of the North and Gateway; Extensions 70s to Seshego; Madiba Park to Legae la Batho; Ladanna to the city and local trips around Seshego will cost R10. A single trip from the Extension 70s to the city will cost R12 and a trip from the main Seshego taxi rank to Emdo Park will cost R15.  SPTA Spokesperson Ally Harmer Mothiba told the Polokwane Review that the increase was decided by the executive in keeping with socio-economic realities faced by South Africans. “Had we not increased the prices, we ran the risk of working only for fuel which would be unfair. We hope commuters will understand,” he said.
