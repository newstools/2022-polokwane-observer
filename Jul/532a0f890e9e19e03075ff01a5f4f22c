LIMPOPO – Four men suspected of being members of a notorious gang of criminals that have been terrorising the Tshiozwi community barely escaped the clutches of the community on June 24, after residents apprehended and assaulted them with sjamboks. The men were thought to have been behind a series of crimes at Tshiozwi, involving robberies, thefts and attacks on residents. A group of community members embarked on a hunt for the men earlier in the morning, and caught up with them at a house in the village. The police struggled to keep the angry residents at bay.

During the ordeal, they apparently pointed out hide-outs where more stolen goods were recovered. Residents were seemingly relieved afterwards. “We know these gangsters; they rob people in broad daylight. With them having been disciplined today, we can now spend our money without fear,” said one resident.Another community member said they were tired of the crime in their area. “This will send a message to everyone who are thinking of committing crimes. We have taken a stand that we will fight fire with fire. We have vowed to clean the area of all crime ourselves. We will not fold our hands while the village is taken to the dogs,” he said. Police spokesperson, Brig Motlafela Mojapelo, warned residents not to take the law into their own hands but to work with the police in apprehending criminals. The police called on members of the public whose shops and houses have been burgled to come to the police station to identify their property. At the time of going to press, the four suspects had been arrested but were still in hospital under police guard. None of the community members involved with the assault of the gang members have been arrested yet.
