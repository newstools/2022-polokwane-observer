LIMPOPO – From the dusty village of Tswera to the athletics tracks of the US, Shirley Nekhubvi (21) is a talent to take note of. She is currently in the US to participate in the World Athletics Championship in Oregon, where she will show her talent in the 400m relay, the 400m mixed relay as well as the 200m. The athlete, who attended Tswera Primary and David Mutshinyalo Secondary schools, hopes to have a successful championship before she leaves for Birmingham, England, to take part in the Commonwealth Games.

Nekhubvi moved to Pretoria in 2020 to become a professional runner in the 100m, 200m and 400m items of the sport. A year later, she moved to Gqeberha (Port Elizabeth) to be coached by Gerrie Posthumus. Nekhubvi has had a good start to this year’s athletics season. She took first position in the 200m at an event held in Potchefstroom in March, and followed that win with a third position in the 400m at the ASA Grand Prix in Bloemfontein in April. Nekhubvi could, however, not make it onto the podium at the ASA Senior Championship as she ended fourth in the 200m. “I also took part in the African Championship in Mauritius, where I participated in the 200m and 400m relay. I managed to qualify for the final in both events, but unfortunately did not finish in a podium position. I am, however, happy with my performances so far this season and I appreciate that these results are building blocks for the future,” she explained. Nekhubvi thanked Nkwalu Sports Management, her coach and physio, and the Makhumisane family for their support. “I will continue to give it my all. I enjoy taking part in these events and I’m proud to fly the South African flag,” she concluded.
