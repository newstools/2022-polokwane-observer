Wife. Husband. Friend. Detective. Someone knows the truth … all of them are lying. Fiona Cummins’ Into the Dark is just that … a dark thriller which sees a family disappear from their beautiful art deco home in an affluent seaside town. Just … disappear. All that’s left is a note written in blood on a mirror. MAKE THEM STOP. Revenge, greed, ambition … this is a cracker of a thriller. PanMacmillan • More secrets, more disappearances in Susan Lewis’  Who’s Lying Now. This one sees an award-winning journalist who appears to have it all – high-flying career, happy marriage – who’s spending lockdown with her husband until one day … she vanishes. A small town, big secrets, trust no one. The best kind of thriller! HarperCollinsPublishers • Closer to home … Sins of The Father by Dire Tladi – a professor of international law at the University of Pretoria and member of UN International Law Commission. It features Tolamo Moagi (who we met in Tladi’s first novel, Blood in the Sand of Justice) … who this time travels the world, from Khartoum to Vienna to Laguna Beach, attempting to expose a sinister conspiracy to control the world.
