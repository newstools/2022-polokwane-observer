POLOKWANE – The 12-year-old from Greenside in Seshego was included in the South African team after his exploits at the national baseball championships held in Cape Town in March. He impressed national selectors with his lethal batting, on-point fielding and ferocious pitching skills as he represented his province. Coach Hendrick Lebesi said he is proud of Matsobane and wished him luck at the international event. “His selection is a first for baseball in Limpopo as we have never had a player represent the country. He has done well since he started playing the sport in 2018 and our wish is that he must continue with the good work.” Matsobane said his inclusion in the national team marks the beginning of a fulfilling baseball career. “I am happy to be part of the national team and I can’t wait for the matches to start.” He explained that he decided to play baseball because it posed a different challenge. “Soccer dominates the area I come from and given the number of players who play soccer, it is difficult to reach the national stage. I chose baseball because I wanted to see what heights I can reach. I want to be the best player and I am glad to live my dream.”
