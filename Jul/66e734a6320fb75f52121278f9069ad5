Posted on the brand’s social media pages, Fiat’s “Touch” video stars a hand that comes into contact with unclean objects, like a shopping cart, ATM keyboards and subway escalators, and then grabs a smartphone. These kinds of actions take place every day and often conceal insidious bacteria. However, the Sanitizing Glove Box is here to help. All one needs to do is put their smartphone in the glove box and start the sanitising procedure. In the second video, entitled “Washing machine”, the same hand puts a wallet, set of keys, sunglasses and cellphone into a washing machine. Once the machine is turned on, the sound of the objects banging around becomes more and more annoying. In an ironic tone, the claim states “there is a better way to sanitise your items”, referring to the Sanitizing Glove Box. Available on the New 500 and the New 500 “La Prima by Bocelli”, an external blue light and a sound will inform you when the three-minute hygienisation cycle has been completed. Fiat has always fostered technology that is, first and foremost, simple and people-friendly. It pursues the idea of “tech it easy”, and complicated instruction manuals are not needed to understand its devices. After all, the Italian brand’s main mission for over 120 years has been to offer innovative technological solutions that are easy-to-use and capable of satisfying the modern needs of everyday driving, as well as protecting people and the environment.
