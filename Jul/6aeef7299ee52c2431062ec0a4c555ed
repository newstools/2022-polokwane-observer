“We had a very rough first quarter due to supply and political challenges which affected stock availability, but we are determined defend our dominance of the passenger car market in South Africa. June was a fantastic month for the Volkswagen brand. Not only did we post the best dealer channel sales since October 2021, we also achieved a 16.4% share in the passenger car market. The T-Cross continues to dominate the A0 SUV segment and our recently launched Taigo also sold 343 units in June 2022. The Polo Vivo and Polo have returned to their dominant positions in the A0 Hatch segment with 1 619 and 1 461 units sold respectively last month,” said Steffen Knapp, head of Volkswagen Passenger Cars. Volkswagen Passenger Cars sold 28 015 units from January to June this year with a market share of 15.9%. The best-selling derivative was the Polo Vivo with 9 469 units sold in the same period. Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles sold 2 566 units in the first six months of 2022.  The Amarok double cab was the best-selling derivative with 1 052 units sold in the first half of the year. In June 2022, the Amarok helped Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles to improve their market share to 4.4%. “We are determined to have a strong second half of the year which will be supported by the new Taigo sales which will ramp-up from July as well as launches of the new T-Roc, all-new Polo Sedan, all-new Tiguan R and the new Golf 8 R,” concluded Knapp. Source: MotorPress
