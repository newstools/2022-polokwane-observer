POLOKWANE – Lepelle Northern Water (LNW) have postponed Tuesday’s (July 12) planned shutdown of water supply from the Olifantspoort plant. Supply was supposed to undergo a 24-hour stoppage “to replace critical valves on the Specon pipeline” but has been postponed to a new date as a result of current challenges affecting supply to Polokwane and surrounding areas. The Polokwane Municiplity spokesperson Thipa Selala said a new date will be communicated once made available by LNW. He added that repairs on the line have been completed and that the plant is expected to pump soon.
