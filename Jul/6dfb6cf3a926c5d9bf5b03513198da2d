An inspiring Grade 12 learner will be running 100km through Thanda Safari game reserve, in the northern reaches of Zululand, from 9-10 July and he needs your support on his mission to raise funds for our wildlife warriors – the rangers. Run for Rangers, in partnership with the Sport for Lives movement and Project Rhino, is a unique fundraiser run motivated by Harry Bailey, a Hilton College learner with a passion for wildlife and a desire to champion the often forgotten, but true heroes of the bush – the rangers. Joining him will be former Sharks Captain and Springbok rugby player, Keegan Daniel, former bodyguard of Nelson Mandela, Rory Steyn, Chris Kingsley (Sport for Lives), as well as some armed Thanda Anti-Poaching Rangers escorting them. And what better time to celebrate the hidden warriors and protectors of the national treasure, our wildlife, than during International World Ranger Month this July? While this event is not open to the public, you are encouraged to assist in raising funds for the rangers by donating money for this run. Harry is hoping to raise R100 000 (R1000 for every kilometer). Go to Sport for Lives to donate.
