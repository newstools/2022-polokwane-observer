You’ll need:
250g sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed; 50g sweet potato, thinly sliced; 1 tin coconut cream; 500ml vegetable stock; olive oil; salt & pepper For the Thai green curry paste – 4 cloves garlic; 2 red onions; 7cm piece of fresh ginger; 2 lemon grass stalks; 2 bird’s eye chillies; 2 tsp ground cumin; 20g fresh coriander; 10g fresh basil; 2 tbsp fish sauce; juice of 1 lime; 1 tbsp olive oil; 1 tsp sesame oil How to: 
Preheat the oven to 180°C.
Place sweet potatoes on a tray and drizzle with olive oil. Roast for an hour or until soft. Remove from the oven, place in a blender and puree or mash.
Combine all paste ingredients in a blender and puree until incorporated and smooth. Add small amounts of water if the mixture is too thick.
Once combined, place in a pot and bring to a simmer over low heat. Add the stock, coconut cream and pureed potatoes and mix well. Season to taste.
To make the sweet potato crisps, toss the thin slices in olive oil and season with salt. Bake at 150°C for 20-25min until golden and crispy. Top soup with fresh herbs and serve with chips. * Recipe & image Imtiyaaz Hart. Received via Capsicum Culinary Studio.
