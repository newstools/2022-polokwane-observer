Serves 6 You’ll need: 6 large potatoes; 500g mixed white button & portabellini mushrooms, sliced; 4 Tbsp olive oil; 1 tsp smoked paprika; 1 tsp chipotle flakes; 1 tsp liquid smoke (available from Woolworths); 250g crème Fraiche; 20g chives, chopped; juice & zest of 1 lemon; salt & pepper; fresh dill, for serving How to: Preheat the oven to 180˚C. Using a fork- prick several steam holes into all the potatoes. Rub the potatoes all over with half of the olive oil. Season well with salt and pepper. Place potatoes into the oven directly on the oven rack. Roast for 60-75 minutes until potatoes are tender. Set aside. Whisk together crème Fraîche, chives and lemon zest. Season with salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste. Keep in the fridge. In a large sauté pan, add the remaining olive oil. Season with paprika, chipotle flakes, salt and liquid smoke. Fry the mushrooms on high heat until they are golden brown. To assemble the stuffed potatoes slice them down the middle. Scoop a dollop of flavoured crème Fraîche into the centre of each one. Top with a generous amount of smoky mushrooms and finish with fresh dill. * Recipe & image by The South African Mushroom Farmers’ Association.
