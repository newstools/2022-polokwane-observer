The beer-styled Loxtonia Pale Amber is the ideal cider to enjoy with butternut soup. Its smooth texture, nuances of caramel and polished apple finish meld beautifully with the soup’s thick and creamy texture and hearty taste. Having spent over 30 snow-capped winters on their apple farm, the Whitfields of Loxtonia, know a thing or two about keeping snug on the chilliest of days. Their trusty family butternut soup recipe is just what you need for an easy weeknight dinner. You’ll need: 3 Tbsp butter; 2 onions chopped; 2 cups butternut, cleaned & chopped; 1 large Granny Smith apple, peeled & chopped; 3 Tbsp flour; 1-2 tsp curry powder; pinch of nutmeg; 3 cups chicken stock; 1½ cups milk; grated rind & juice of 1 orange; pinch salt, pepper & sugar; a dollop of cream per serving; chopped parsley If you are lactose or gluten intolerant or vegan, the following substitutes can be made:
1½ tbsp corn flour; 3 cups vegetable stock; 1½ cups almond milk; a dollop of coconut cream per serving How to: Sauté the onions in butter (or oil) until soft and flavourful. Add the butternut, apple, orange rind and juice to the onions to absorb and develop in flavour (about 3 minutes), stirring from time to time. Add the flour, curry powder and nutmeg, blending with the vegetables. Add the stock and milk. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the vegetables are tender. Liquidise the solids in a food processor or rub them through a sieve. Taste, then add salt, pepper and a pinch of sugar. Serve topped with a dollop of cream and a sprinkling of parsley. Handy tip: This soup improves with time so prepare a day or two in advance if you can and keep it refrigerated. Make a large batch and freeze it. *Recipe and image by www.loxtonia.co.za
