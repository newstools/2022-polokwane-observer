POLOKWANE – With no financial help from family and friends, Mabotha finally opened his own mobile car wash named CC The Hustle. With the business, he already created employment for the youth within his community. “I created employment, especially for graduates who struggle to find jobs in the field they studied for. Most job opportunities require a qualification and not everyone can afford to go to school. To wash a car won’t be a hassle for most people and I just want to see my age group off the streets,” he explained and added he employed Tito Matlala and Gideon Mothiba to assist him in his company. Mabotha told Polokwane Observer he always wanted to open and own a company one day and it motivated him to be patient and save his money. “We use machines instead of buckets of water to wash our clients’ cars and we are more affordable than our competition,” he said. He explained he takes any challenges head on and he sees it as a learning opportunity to find out how he can overcome his challenges. “If I repeatedly struggle with a challenge, I know that I will not grow as a person and the company won’t grow either,” he added. Aside from the mobile car wash, Mabotha offers property maintenance and management services such as plumbing, electrical work, welding, painting, tile insertions, carpentry, as well as cooking and various cleaning services at homes and events. “I really want to grow and help other people in general to create more jobs and opportunities for those in need so that they can support their families as well,” he said.
