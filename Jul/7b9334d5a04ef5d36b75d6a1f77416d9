POLOKWANE – The municipality recently announced that aspiring traders should apply for permits. The application process closes on August 15. Shokane, who spoke on behalf of traders, said they have had arguments with traders who are not permitted to trade in the area. “They languish and deprive us from a healthy trading competition because some of them sell at much lower prices and without permits,” he explained. Shokane said most of these traders are situated along Market Street. “They decrease our business prospects and  sometimes sell counterfeit goods.” Shokane said they are hopeful that the municipality will listen to their pleas and follow up on hints of illegal trading in parts of the city. “There are too many people who take chances who could ruin the name of inner city trading if not checked by municipal by-law enforcement officers,” he explained.
