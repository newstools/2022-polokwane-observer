POLOKWANE – The MEC for Education Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya has pleaded with parents and guardians to register their children for admission to public schools in 2023. Admission applications for Gr R to Gr 11 commenced on May 24, 2022 and will close on Thursday (July 29). Education media liaison officer Mike Maringa said the department will only process walk-in applications for the 2023 academic year. “The department has put emphasis on a proactive approach as it will ease the annual registration challenges faced by schools and circuits in the beginning of the year,” he said.

The department’s focus is mainly on the lower grades (Gr R and Gr 1) and learners who are either switching schools or progressing to senior schools. “Applicants will receive feedback in or before the end of August 2022 and returning learners will be issued with confirmation forms in September 2022,” Maringa said.
