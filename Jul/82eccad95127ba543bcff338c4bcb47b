LIMPOPO – The management of Limpopo police have strongly denounced a mob-attack incident that led to the death of a teacher in the Lebowakgomo policing area on Saturday (July 2). The victim, who is originally from Kwa Zulu-Natal and resided in Lebowakgomo A, was driving his vehicle in possession of an unknown number of goats that he purchased in Mamaolo in the Ga-Mphahlele village when he was stopped by a mob. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the man was pulled out of his vehicle and was severely assaulted by the mob before he and his vehicle was set alight as the mob suspected him of stock theft. “Police were summoned to the scene and upon arrival, found a burnt out bakkie and the victim lying few metres away, burned beyond recognition. The suspected stolen goats were not found at the scene of the crime,” Mojapelo said. He added that a manhunt has since been launched for the suspects involved and urged anyone with information to contact the investigating officer Sergeant Makadani on 072 029 7499, the crime stop number 08600 10111, the nearest police station or the MySAPS app. “Communities are are cautioned not to take the law into their own hands but rather hand suspects over to the police for further investigation and prosecution.”
