If you’re looking for a thrifty art project for preschoolers to do today, make some leaf prints! Leaf printing is fun and easy, and produces a piece of art pretty enough to hang on a wall in your home. It is also a great project to help children to recognise the trees and plants in your garden based on the form and complexity of their leaves.
