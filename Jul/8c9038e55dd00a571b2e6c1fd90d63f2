POLOKWANE – Varying stages of load-shedding will be implemented by Eskom over the next few weeks. Eskom employees embarked on a strike over pay issues last week which has led to ongoing power cuts across South Africa. The power utility said the power generation system will take a while to fully recover to pre-strike levels. As a result, a load-shedding schedule for the week has been released which includes Stages 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Eskom said Monday and Tuesday’s stages are confirmed and that stages for Wednesday through to Friday will be dependant on returning generating units to service.  “Depending on several possibilities, it is anticipated that load-shedding will gradually be lowered to Stage 2 by the weekend,” a statement read.
