We’ve rounded up three great shows you should keep an eye out for this week. Start with a survival drama that follows a lone survivor battling the elements in the wilderness to stay alive. Then watch a true-crime story of a respectable dentist and pillar of the community, who became a killer in partnership with a Sunday school teacher. Or opt for a local crime documentary in which each episode takes you to the heart of a brutal incident that gripped the nation. What does it mean to survive? The mere mention of the word conjures up a flurry of possibilities. Netflix’s Keep Breathing tackles two of the most prominent scenarios — humanity vs. nature and the fight against inner demons. Set in the Canadian wilderness, this limited series explores a lone survivor’s struggle to find her way back to civilization. On Netflix from July 28.   Set in the Baptist community in Coleraine in Northern Ireland, the drama centres around the deadly affair between dentist Colin Howell and Sunday school teacher Hazel Buchanan, but far from being a work of fiction, it is all based on a true story. Watch The Secret on BritBox from July 28.    From the producers of Carte Blanche, Strangers You Know is a hard-hitting true crime docuseries that uncovers the stories behind some of the most brutal crimes in South Africa’s recent history, focussing on cases of gender-based violence and women who lost their lives at the hands of men they knew. Catch it on Showmax.
