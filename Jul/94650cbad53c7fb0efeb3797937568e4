Whether you are a zebra stripes or leopard spots kind of girl, the new wildlife-inspired range of Crocs has a look for every mood – and they are wild! While they make a whole new fashion statement on the outside, the inside of the classic Crocs sandal and the classic clog still boasts all the comfort Croc-lovers expect including the original Croslite™ foam cushion to give your foot all-day-long support. Take your feet to the next level by adding some Jibbitz Charms™ to give your shoes a custom look. Things are only going to get wilder in the coming months, with new prints expected soon, so keep an eye out for what’s to come.
