LIMPOPO – “Let’s remain calm,” says Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba after the first case of monkeypox in Limpopo was confirmed today (July 10). “We can confirm that the case is an outpatient who is currently isolating and requires no hospital admission,” she added. Departmental spokesperson Neil Shikwambana said in a statement that the case has been confirmed by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases. “The case is that of a 42-year-old male tourist from Switzerland who is on holiday in the province. The man’s symptoms included a rash, lymphadenopathy, muscle ache and fatigue,” he explained. Ramathuba said the department has already sent officials to attend to the case. “Three contacts have been identified and none of them have showed any symptoms thus far,” she explained. Ramathuba urged residents to remain calm. “Those who interact with a lot of people are urged to continue wearing their masks, even though Covid-19 protocols have been relaxed,” she concluded.
