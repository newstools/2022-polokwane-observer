POLOKWANE – Sun Meropa Casino and Entertainment World was the place to be last Saturday when the Kofifi Dance Party Winter Edition had party-goers on their feet and in their best vintage clothes. With the theme ‘Tot Piet Kom, Dobol tot Piet Kom’ people from as far as Botswana showed up in vintage cars and old school boots to dance the night away. Many well-known DJs kept party-goers on the dance floor throughout the event. According to Mahlasedi Media Communication founder Fortune ‘DJ Cappuccino’ Maswanganyi, this is one of the best Kofifi dance parties yet.      “As soon as the lockdown restrictions were lifted, people started flocking to events again. You can see by the numbers that attended the annual Kofifi Dance Party Winter Edition and dressed according to the theme. The party-goers were lovely and we appreciate that the event attracted a professional and mature crowd,” said Maswanganyi. He added that the Kofifi Dace Party in the summer will be much bigger as it will then be the tenth anniversary of the event on October 29 and they expect a huge turnout. “We will make sure to expand the tent to accommodate more people. We will have live performances and we are calling for local business people to come and partner with us so that we can make the event memorable,” he said.      He added that the Kofifi Dance Party Winter Edition has improved in terms of productions. “For the live performances, we used Pioneer CDJ 3000 players, and most of the DJs will tell you that it’s only DJ Cappuccino and Black Coffee who can work with that machine. We have upped our game with regard to the production and it’s because of the years and years of experience,” he said.
