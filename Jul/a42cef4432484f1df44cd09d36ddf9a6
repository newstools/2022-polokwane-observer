POLOKWANE – The Seshego Polokwane Taxi Association (SPTA) told the Polokwane Review that they are in no way involved or responsible for the stoning of two Leeto La Polokwane (LLP) buses on Tuesday (July 5). SPTA spokesperson Ally Mothiba said it is unfortunate that their name is being associated with the vandalism amid speculation that their drivers are responsible for the incident.

The rationale for these incidents is not known yet and no injuries have been reported. The city’s transport department strongly condemns these acts of vandalism which affects the city’s ability to provide efficient and safe public transportation services,” she said. Mothiba added that they sympathise with LLP and those affected. “The SPTA does not encourage vandalism or violence towards public transportation as we are all in the same boat and work towards the same goal which is ferrying commuters,” he said. Malakalaka said the matter has been reported to law enforcement, who are monitoring the route and added that damage to municipal property is a criminal offence and may lead to prosecution.
