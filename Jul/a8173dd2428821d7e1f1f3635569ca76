LIMPOPO – Wheelchair tennis player Ronewa Mudzanani has a dream to one day compete in a grand slam such as Wimbledon and the US Open. The 25-year-old tennis player says he needs financial assistance to pay for physio sessions. “I have cerebral palsy and was diagnosed with scoliosis, which causes discomfort. I need to visit the physio once a week,” he told CV and added that he goes to a private clinic for these sessions. Mudzanani hails from Vhurivhuri village outside Thohoyandou and has played tennis since he was in Gr 9 at Thohoyandou Technical High School. “Patrick Selepe realised that I have the talent to play the sport. I used to attend tennis camps over weekends and started to play at an international level in 2014,” he explained.

Mudzanani, who practises for at least three hours every Saturday and Sunday, represented South Africa at the 2021 BNP Paribas World Team Cup in Sardinia, Italy. “We won the bronze medal and this was a big achievement for me. My dream is to see myself participate at big tournaments and being ranked in the top 15 in the word,” he told CV. Another dream of his is to represent the country at the Paralympics. He said that he, however, needs sponsors to play at other tournaments to improve his career ranking, as well as money to cover his medical expenses. “The doctors didn’t notice that I have a disability when I was born. My mom saw I couldn’t stand on my own and when she took me back to the hospital, the doctors noted my spinal condition. “I have had a lot of problems with my back recently, and it takes time to get treatment for this condition. I would rather have wanted to spend the time on the tennis court to improve my skills.” Those who can assist Mudzanani can contact Mavu Sports Development director Bram van Wijck on 083 271 6957 or 011 264 0542.
