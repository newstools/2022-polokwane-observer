POLOKWANE – Thornhill partnered with A Million Moons, a charity organisation that prepares dignity packs consisting of basic personal hygiene products for boys and girls, and through this initiative they request that community members give back to the less fortunate. There will also be a washing line at the shopping centre on the day where people can hang their unused clothing, which will then be donated to the less fortunate. All residents are invited to donate unused clothes or towards the children’s dignity packs. Donations can be dropped off at the shopping centre’s centre management office before July 16. There will be a pop-up stall at the shopping centre for the whole month of July where donations towards the dignity packs can be made. Thornhill Shopping Centre marketing manager Marise Rademan quoted Nelson Mandela, who said “there is no greater gift than that of giving one’s time and energy to help others, without expecting anything in return”, and urged people to participate in this initiative. The donations will be handed over to various shelters on July 18.
