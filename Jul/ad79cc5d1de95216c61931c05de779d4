POLOKWANE – A planned temporary closure of two-lane sections of Nelson Mandela Drive will affect motorists due to reconstruction work in the area. The closure will take place from tomorrow, July 21 to August 31 and Leeto la Polokwane spokesperson Rebotile Malakalaka said traffic will be accommodated in remaining lanes in each direction. One lane in each direction will be closed for 250m approaching the Sand River Bridge between corner Zebediela and Vermikuliet Streets. Malakalaka said the reconstruction scope of work includes compaction adjacent to the brigde structure as well as tying the road levels in with the bridge. “Once the construction is complete, traffic will be diverted to the upgraded lanes while construction continues in the other lane. Upon completion, all lanes will be open for traffic.
