Passing on the booze? No problem. With these sophisticated spirits, you won’t have to sacrifice taste, enjoyment or the flavour of top-quality natural ingredients. It’s no surprise that the ‘No & Low alcohol’ movement is gaining momentum. If there’s one thing we’ve learned over the past couple of years it’s that your health is your most important asset. Make a start by cutting out alcohol for July – giving your liver a break, lowering your blood pressure, losing weight, being clear-headed and being able to drive yourself home. What’s not to like? What to drink when you’re not drinking  Mixing with the best
To get the most from these sophisticated, alcohol-free spirits, you need to mix with the best. Fever-Tree works on the premise that if the mixer is three-quarters of the drink, it should be the very best. The extensive range of top-quality mixers is made with specially selected ingredients from around the world and is free from artificial flavourings and sweeteners. If you’re celebrating a better, healthier you, then why not do it with a cocktail? Try these trendy cocktails that you can make at home.  Lemon spritz
