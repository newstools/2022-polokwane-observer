LIMPOPO – A man and a woman have been arrested by the Hawks’ serious commercial crime investigation unit in relation to the theft of over R36m belonging to a deceased First National Bank (FNB) client. The couple, aged 28 and 43-years-old were arrested in Johannesburg on Saturday (July 16) and were alleged to have received R6m from another suspect arrested for this case. The Hawks’ provincial spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke said the couple fought over the money when the sender requested it back. “The girlfriend opened a case of assault against her boyfriend in Johannesburg and the police discovered that the money they were fighting over was stolen and that the Limpopo Hawks were investigating the matter,” he explained. Maluleke said R5.5m of the R6m that they had received was returned to the sender. The sender, Thabiso Matenda was a former bank employee who was arrested on Friday (June 10) by the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Investigation Unit for allegedly stealing R36 989 051.67 belonging to a deceased client. Matenda, a Malawian national, was based in Louis Trichardt and allegedly opened the profile of the client who had died in an accident without authorisation. “The accused connived with his accomplice to open a new bank account, link it to the deceased’s account and spent the money. The bank discovered the shenanigans and reported the matter to the Hawks. Some of the stolen money was allegedly donated to a church,” Maluleke said. Matenda remains in custody after his bail was opposed. “The couple is expected to appear before the Makhado Magistrate’s Court today (July 18). Investigations continue and more arrests are expected,” Maluleke said.
