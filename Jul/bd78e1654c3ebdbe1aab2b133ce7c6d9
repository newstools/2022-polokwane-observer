POLOKWANE – Lepelle Northern Water (LNW) said they were forced to stop operation at the Olifantspoort Plant once again due to an undetected leak that a team of welders were working on. The stoppage comes less than 12 hours after water supply to Polokwane was affected by a pipe burst at a high lift pump station outlet line, which was repaired by dawn. The Polokwane Municipality spokesperson Thipa Selala said they were informed by LNW that repairs on the undetected leak will take up to four hours to complete. “At 08:30, the water utility, further indicated that the ‘scouring of the pipeline will be done within the next hour, thereafter welding of the pipe will begin’.” Selala added that the Olifantspoort line to Polokwane is empty and it will take some time until water reaches all areas of supply once restored. “The municipality will continue to provide supply through water tankers as a temporary relief measure,” he concluded.
