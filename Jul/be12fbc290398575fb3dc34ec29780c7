POLOKWANE – The South African National Council on Alcoholism (Sanca) Limpopo said they are in support of the suggestion to increase the legal drinking age limit to 21. However, changing the age limit is only one determining factor and is not enough to stop underage drinking. President Cyril Ramaphosa stated recently in his weekly letter to the public that the increased social acceptance of drinking among the youth has become a serious issue in a nation where the majority of drinkers are classified as binge drinkers by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

We call upon our police to step up the enforcement of laws that prohibit the sale of alcohol close to schools and enhance monitoring of outlets to ensure alcohol is not being sold to minors.” Boloka Hezekiel, director of Sanca Limpopo, says to combat underage drinking, we need real, effective prevention programmes and everyone has to play a role. “We must keep in mind that children learn through observation, which makes becoming better role models even more important than it was before.” He added the department of social development and other interested parties must invest heavily in prevention programmes, and the liquor board must ensure that South African Breweries (SAB) and other liquor retailers do the same. “Government can help with the establishment of recreational facilities, such as sports fields, art centres, and libraries so that young people can engage themselves there,” Boloka said.
