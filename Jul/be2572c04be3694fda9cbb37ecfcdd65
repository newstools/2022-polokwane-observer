POLOKWANE – The 15 people and 13 juristic persons (companies) who face charges related to corruption and fraud at the Mogalakwena Municipality appeared before the Polokwane Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Wednesday (July 20). According to National Prosecuting Authority Limpopo spokesperson Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, 16 people and 13 juristic persons (companies) face 121 charges of corruption, three of money laundering and three of conspiracy to commit corruption. Among the accused are the former mayor of Mogalakwena, Andrina Matsemela, her sister Nkadi Mabusela, as well as Jabu and Tolly Mashamaite. The alleged fraudulent activities related to tender irregularities reportedly took place between 2016 and 2019 and the total amount involved in corruption is around R15m. On Wednesday, the court ruled that the matter is set for pre-trial. The ruling came after the defence applied for the case to be struck off the roll as they felt the state unreasonably delayed the case. The application was overruled as a few defence lawyers claimed to not have received the content of the docket, while others received the content from the prosecutors. Presiding officer Matlaba Kganyago handed the ruling down and said that “no false accusations can be made on the doorsteps of the prosecutions, as they furnished the content of the docket to legal representatives of the accused”. The court dismissed the application and ordered the matter to be postponed to October 7 for pre-trial. South African National Civic Organisation Waterberg secretary Charles Makobela welcomed the ruling. “There must be accountability of the money that were embezzled through service providers without any services provided to Mogalakwena residents.” He added the trial will send a strong message to councillors and municipal officials who are expected to lead by example and follow the rules and regulations as set out in the Municipal Finance Management Act 56 of 2003, as well as other pieces of legislation.
