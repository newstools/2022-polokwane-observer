POLOKWANE – The 27-year-old designer goes by the nickname ‘States’ and is the owner of Top Class Designs. He started to work in the fashion industry in 2016 at the age of 21. “Ever since then, I focused to build my brand and grow my business. I have always been passionate and that very same passion is what still drives me today,” he explained. States shared it is his love for clothes and being unique that pushed him to excel as much as he has in the industry. “I found that being in the industry is inspiring, particularly since this profession places you under a spotlight in front of many people,” he said. States specialises in bespoke suits, as well grooms’ wear, accessories and occasional wear. He added the fashion industry can get difficult because the competition is tough and said, as a bread winner, he had to learn to count every cent and be strategic in his lifestyle. “For every cent I use, I have to think of home first. I’ve had to find myself and figure out how I want to contribute to my community, and I found it is to be a role model,” he said. The highlight of his career has been to grow his brand and work with various people like Sandile Dikgare, Sally Sithole and Zodwa Mdingi.
