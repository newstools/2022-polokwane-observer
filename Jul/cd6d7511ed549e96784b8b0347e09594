To minimise downtime and extract maximum productivity from a truck, it is best to plan for service and parts with an Isuzu Mobility Plan. Running at maximum payload over long distances, Isuzu trucks deliver outstanding economic cost and productivity benefits in terms of cents per ton kilometre – especially when serviced according to the recommended schedule. And that is where the Isuzu Mobility Plans match truck operator expectations in driving down costs, managing the risk, and achieving maximum first economic life before a major overhaul. What expectations do truck operators have in a maintenance contract?
• Provision of fixed cost maintenance with no costly surprises
• Budgeting in advance for all labour and parts, servicing, and maintenance
• No rand value limitations on claims for major components
• Protection against inflation by paying today’s prices
• Minimising downtime on vehicles when in for a service
• Warranty protection. Isuzu Motors South Africa matches all this with the innovative and all-new Isuzu mobility cents per kilometre (CPK) maintenance contract. What is different about a CPK contract? It is based on the actual kilometres travelled and can be applied to all new Isuzu trucks with less than 9 000km on the odometer while under 12 months old at point of sale. The CPK plan is for companies only and is paid monthly, billed according to the kilometres travelled. VAT is a critical component of truck financing. The VAT refund can be applied to the CPK contract to make this Isuzu service product even more cost-effective. The CPK plan allows the company to match its revenue generated by a particular vehicle to the actual expense incurred in a particular month – it also follows seasonal trends such as limited distances covered during low season. In addition, should a vehicle be off the road for crash repairs there will be no maintenance charges in the absence of kilometres covered.  There is no minimum billing per month. Businesses can maximise their cashflow by paying monthly only for the kilometres driven and not just the distance predicted. This allows businesses to record and manage income and expenses accurately for a particular period. Tracking fleet utilisation is a key discipline of fleet management. The CPK plan introduces accurate, real-time measurement of how the truck fleet is being utilised, and then again down to the level of individual vehicles on specific routes. Telematics is adjunct to effective and modern fleet maintenance. Isuzu satisfies modern fleet management expectations with the most up to date telematics system. Telematics offers real-time fleet management. Telematics is also leading evidence in any court action following a road incident and thus protects a driver against spurious claims. The entire Isuzu range benefits from a telematics-ready truck and stolen vehicle recovery hardware installed at the factory. This includes a panic button and driver ID tag reader already installed. Compatible with the MixTelematics fleet management system, it is also compatible with existing third party fleet management systems at a small additional cost. The stolen vehicle recovery service ready has been installed for some years now. The CPK Plan is a maintenance and service plan and warranty all together with the standard exclusions that are excluded in the market for these types of products, such as tyres, top-up oils, sound equipment (radios), truck bodies and anything damaged, missing or broken. Senior vice president of revenue generation Southern African Customs Union, Craig Uren of Isuzu Motors South Africa, concludes, “Isuzu Mobility CPK Maintenance Plan is a true component of Isuzu as a lifecycle brand. Isuzu’s truck brand leadership in Southern Africa for the past 10 years is based on service – we are a service organisation that also sells new Isuzu trucks.” Source: Isuzu
