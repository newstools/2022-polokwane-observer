Since its introduction earlier this year, no less than 3 500 motorists has accepted Kia’s invitation to drive the Sonet.
“The Sonet was one of the most anticipated new Kia models in several years when it was introduced to the South African market in April 2021,” says Stephen Crosse, sales and marketing director, Kia South Africa. “At the time, the global supply chain constraints hampered our efforts to launch Sonet with a broader range of engine and transmission options, but as some of these constraints begin to normalise our persistent desire to expand the Sonet range has now come to fruition. We are confident that the new turbocharged derivatives will also surpass our expectations.”  Turbocharge your life The new Kia Sonet 1.0 T-GDi is equipped with Kia’s advanced 1.0-litre, 3-cylinder turbo-petrol engine mated with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (7DCT). A new engine in the local Kia stable, the 1.0 T-GDi boasts outputs of 88kW at 6 000r/min and a stout 172Nm of torque on a plateau from 1 500-4 000r/min. This new engine places easy-driving characteristics at the forefront, balancing more than sufficient punch for safe overtaking manoeuvres with low engine speeds at highway velocities for improved fuel consumption and refinement and a satisfyingly sporty 3-cylinder thrum. In the combined cycle, the 1,0 T-GDi option emits a mere 137g/km of CO2 emissions. Well-equipped EX plus flagship EX+ Feature highlights on the mid-tier EX derivative, to name but a few, include: • 8-inch HD touchscreen infotainment with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android AutoBluetooth with voice control
• Height-adjustable driver’s seat
• Leather-trimmed steering wheel and gear shifter
• Rear-view camera and rear park distance control (PDC) combination
• Artificial leather and cloth seat trim
• Electronic stability control (ESC) ABS with EBD
• Hill-start assist control (HAC)
• Dual front airbags
• ISOFIX child-seat anchoring points
• 16-inch alloy wheels
• Automatic headlamp activation  In addition to the EX trim level, the new EX+ specification offer even more. “As more customers continue to migrate into the crossover and compact SUV segments, it’s critical to balance price positioning and perceived affordability with an array of features and benefits that present an exceptional value proposition,” comments Crosse. “With the introduction of the new turbocharged derivatives and its established reputation as one of the highest quality offerings in its segment, the Kia Sonet cements its position as one of the most desirable and most complete options available in the market today.”
The two new 1.0 T-GDI derivatives are priced at a recommended retail price of R359 995 and R389 995 respectively. All Sonet models ship as standard with Kia’s industry-leading unlimited kilometre, 5-year warranty (inclusive of roadside assistance), as well as a prepaid 4-year/60 000 km service plan.
