POLOKWANE – A massive fuel price increase will come into effect on July 6. The announcement was made by the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Gwede Mantashe who said that a rise in crude oil prices, the rand/dollar exchange rate and the addition of levies that were halted have affected the price of fuel per litre. 93 ULP petrol will increase by R2.37, 95 ULP by R2.57 and diesel by R2.30 per litre. Illuminating parafffin will increase by R1.66 a litre. Government said the temporary reduction in the general fuel levy of 75 cents per litre will be withdrawn from August 3 due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict which has affected fuel prices globally.
