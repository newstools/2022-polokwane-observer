POLOKWANE – The Limpopo High Court in Polokwane has sentenced Rembuluwani Lukane Ndou (29), Ben Ndou (29) and Small Ngobeni Khoza (28) to a combined 384 years in prison after they were found guilty on 25 charges of crimes committed in and around Seshego, Westenburg and Leeuwkuil. According to the investigating officer, Sgt Tlou Chokoe, the trio tormented residents in what he referred to as a reign of terror that lasted for two months. “They were part of a group of criminals calling themselves by name, widely associated with Islamist tied terrorist group, Boko Harram.” Their crimes included murder, attempted murder, the possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, house burglaries ins with the intention to rob, robbery with aggravating circumstances, malicious damage to property, theft and house robberies. According to a statement by the police in Limpopo, some of their victims include players of the Magezi Football Club who were robbed of their cellphones, soccer kit, shoes and clothes at gunpoint during a robbery that was committed on October 18, 2017, in their club house. Chokoe confirmed that the arrest of the trio was sparked by a tip-off received after one of them was wounded in a shootout. In reaction to sentencing, provincial police commissioner Lt Genl Thembi Hadebe said he was satisfied at the outcome. “We are content with the long jail sentences handed down by the high court against these heartless thugs who were terrorising the communities. The investigating skills of the detective and team that assisted him, are highly appreciated and commendable.”
