POLOKWANE – Three people have been confirmed dead following a shooting incident in Seshego Zone 3 earlier today (July 20). According to a statement by police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Malesela Ledwaba, a 27-year-old police constable attached to Roedtan Police Station shot a woman, a man and thereafter himself. “He went to a rental apartment and reportedly found a woman, believed to be his girlfriend, in the company of another man. He confronted them and then shot them dead before he turned the firearm on himself,” Ledwaba explained. He said the trio were certified dead on the scene. “The officer’s service pistol was found on the scene. It is not clear at this stage what prompted the incident but domestic-related challenges cannot be ruled out,” Ledwaba added. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe urged officers to seek professional assistance when faced with relationship challenges. “Our members are urged to make use of available internal professionals whose responsibility is to look after the employees’ health and wellness. Officers should not resort to violence when dealing with their challenges,” Hadebe said. Two murder cases have been opened, as well as an inquest. The incident has been condemned by Limpopo Community Safety MEC Polly Boshielo who described the event as ‘tragic and traumatic’. “We encourage our police officers to seek help when they experience personal problems of any kind. Our wellness section is always ready to listen and offer professional assistance,” she explained. The MEC confirmed that psychosocial professionals will be made available to offer necessary counselling to the affected families.
