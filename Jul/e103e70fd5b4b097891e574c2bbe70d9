POLOKWANE – They are driven by a desire to build a soccer culture that keeps kids off the streets and involved in something productive and exciting such as soccer. Kgobe and Legodi hosted their first soccer tournament recently and four teams: Flora Park Football Club, Sweet Boys Football Club, Thunderstorm Football Academy and Scotch Football Club took part in the u/13 division. The tournament was played at the sports ground in Seshego Zone 4 and matches consisted two halves of 25 minutes each. The duo said they hope this tournament is the first of many they will host in their area. “We are motivated by the potential we see in these young boys in our neighbourhood. We hope to have even more teams and sponsors involved in our next tournament,” Kgobe explained. He highlighted how his family helped make the tournament a success as they helped with the arrangements and donated money. Thunderstorm head coach Kgwerano Maila expressed how happy he is to be involved in a tournament that brings kids together through sport. “I can see these boys get better and better as they become used to playing in tournaments. They have potential to become great.” Scotch FC and Sweet Boys FC played in the final, which was won 2-0 by the former.
