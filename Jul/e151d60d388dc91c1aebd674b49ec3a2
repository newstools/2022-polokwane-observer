The theme for 2022 is Celebration, Innovation and Aspiration and is based on the evolution of the industry and technology over the past few years and celebrating the resilience and contribution the automotive and related industries make to the South African economy. “In recent years and months, the automotive industry went through many challenges, but now the time is right for the passion to return. We honestly can’t wait to be back at Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit and judging by the very early ticket sales our patrons and followers are just as eager,” commented Michael Dehn, managing director of Messe Frankfurt South Africa, the event organiser. With a number of leading brands on board, including Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Chery, Citroen, Dunlop, Fiat, Jeep, Mercedes-Benz, MOPAR, Opel, Peugeot, Suzuki and Toyota, the pit doors are filling up quickly. Brands are using this opportunity to take their vehicles to the public in a time when footfall to dealerships has dropped. The benefit to both exhibitors and visitors is the interactive and experiential nature of the show, unlike traditional motor shows of the past. It’s an opportunity for consumers to get into the vehicles and test drive the cars.   2022 highlights from participating brands will include: Mercedes-Benz showcasing the Mercedes-Benz EQ Electric Intelligence range and other special surprises in store. Volvo Car South Africa will be exhibiting its electrified Recharge range which includes Mild-hybrids, Plug-in Hybrids, and the all-electric XC40. Visitors will also get to see and experience the latest Toyota Gazoo Racing models, in addition to the rest of the Toyota range. Suzuki will add to the excitement with the evergreen Jimny on the 4×4 track, the Swift Sport on the main track, and the new generation Baleno available for you to test on the handling track. There will be a wide range of Suzuki lifestyle vehicles and motorcycles for you to view and experience.            Source: MotorPress
