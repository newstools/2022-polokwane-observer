The AA’s innovative 125-point vehicle inspection service, in conjunction with independent dealerships and AA-approved workshops, will be available across the country. “In developing this product and service, the AA and our brand partner, AA Warranties, recognised that we can offer support to independent dealerships while providing the motoring public a valuable and credible service that enhances the selling and purchasing experience,” said Willem Groenewald, CEO of AA. Critically, the inspection process does not offer a “pass” or “fail” assessment of a vehicle. Instead, it provides a report that states the “facts” of the vehicle at the time of assessment. “This is an important distinction because the report is not intended to favour anyone; it simply gives a true, unbiased reflection of the vehicle at the time of inspection. This is a powerful tool for both sellers and buyers, as it removes any doubts about the vehicle’s condition,” said Groenewald. Last week, the first vehicle to be sold following an AA Certified Pre-Owned inspection was sold by Auto King in Milnerton, Cape Town. Les Herring, the dealer principal here, said the decision to offer the AA Certified Pre-Owned inspection was an easy one. “The AA is a long-established, trusted and credible brand, and being associated with it is powerful for my own brand. This service adds immense value to my customers, and I believe it will benefit my business greatly in the long run,” said Herring. The AA has been engaging with independent dealerships across the country regarding the AA Certified Pre-Owned accreditation. The intention is to have a minimum of 150 dealerships in South Africa offering the service in the next two years. Source: AA
