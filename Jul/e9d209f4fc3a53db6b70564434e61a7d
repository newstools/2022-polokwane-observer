“I was happy until certain things started to happen… Like the control and constantly being reminded that I bring nothing to the table except my pretty face.” Mohale and his husband Somizi Mhlongo became the poster couple for gay marriage in South Africa when their SAFTA-nominated 2020 wedding special, Somizi & Mohale: The Union, was labelled The Union of the Year and set a then record for the most first day views on Showmax at launch. Their relationship was also a central focus on Living The Dream With Somizi S4, which won the 2020 SAFTA for Best Structured or Docu-Reality Show. But Somhale wasn’t the fairytale union it seemed. This became clear when the audio of an off-the-record interview with Mohale was leaked in August 2021, including allegations of how Somizi physically abused him. Living The Dream With Somizi S5, which finished its chart-topping run on Showmax last Wednesday, told Somizi’s version of their breakup; now it’s time to hear from Mohale himself, in his own words, on his own time. In the trailer, Mohale tells Aldrin that Somizi did bring him joy. “I was really myself when I was with him and I could express myself in many ways… I was happy until certain things started to happen… Like the control and constantly being reminded that I bring nothing to the table except my pretty face.” The trailer also shows Mohale addressing his abuse allegations against Somizi. “I remember him saying that he needs to mess up my face,” Mohale says to Aldrin, before the trailer cuts to him talking about how, “I crawled down the stairs.” The trailer then ends with Aldrin asking Mohale why he didn’t open a case. Produced by Teddy Geldart’s Dopezuluboi Productions (2021 SAFTA nominee Lebo M: Coming Home and S5 of Living The Dream With Somizi), Mohale: On the Record will premiere on 4 August 2022, first on Showmax.
