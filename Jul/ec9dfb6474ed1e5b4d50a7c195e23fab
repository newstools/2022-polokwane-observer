POLOKWANE – The spokesperson of the Capricorn District Municipality has refuted claims made by the DA at the end of May that close to R500 000 was spent on this year’s State of the District Address (SODA) which was delivered at the Jack Botes Hall 10 days prior. Instead, the district municipality spent R302 000, CDM municipal spokesperson Jabu Masondo confirmed. In an initial statement, the DA demanded a breakdown of the overall expenditure arguing that wasteful expenditure was incurred. DA councillor in the district council, Bianca Mocke says the initial budget plan shared with council members shows that the district municipality spent R500 000 on the address which they find unreasonable as the money could have been repurposed for severe water shortages in communities within the municipality’s jurisdiction. Masondo replied that, as the address was a budgeted project and key performance area which needs to be achieved every year the DA knew what was finalised in the consultative meetings. “The breakdown shows that R33 000 was spent on transportation for all local municipality members in attendance, R5 000 was spent on a sign language interpreter, R21 000 on video coverage and a Facebook live stream, R16 000 on decorations, and R156 000 on radio advertising and outside broadcasts. In addition, R71 000 was spent on catering.” Considering the municipality’s recent regressed audit opinion, Mocke said the municipality needs to be stricter in its spending. “We are constantly communicating in all our committees and council that we want to see this municipality deliver exceptional services to the communities we serve. We want to see that the money meant for the people is spent on them. We will continue to keep this executive accountable, as we have from the very start of this council because we represent voices keeping us accountable to that effect.” The DA is expected to raise the matter in the next council sitting.
