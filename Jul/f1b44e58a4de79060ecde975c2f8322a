Toyota South Africa Motors (TSAM) has continued to top the sales charts in 2022 despite suffering significant damage to its Prospecton Plant, which produces Hilux, Fortuner, Hiace, Corolla Quest and Corolla Cross, on April 12. TSAM registered a sales total of 7 439 (market share of 18.1%) in June, including 5 361 units in the passenger segment, which rendered Toyota the leader in this hotly contested category. Toyota has sold a total of 64 001 units since January 2022, and is currently leading the race with a market share of 25.2% year-to-date. Aggregate domestic new vehicle sales in June 2022, at 41 019 units, reflected an increase of 2 888 units, or 7.6%, from the 38 131 vehicles sold in June 2021. Export sales recorded an increase of 5 044 units, or 18.0%, to 33 054 units in June 2022 compared to the 28 010 vehicles exported in June 2021. “Our sales performance up till now proves that Toyota has an even firmer grip on its long-term position as the best-selling automotive brand in the country; it is particularly astounding that TSAM is still number one despite the cessation of production for popular vehicles such as Hilux, Hiace Ses’fikile, Corolla Quest, Corolla Cross and Fortuner,” says Leon Theron: senior vice president of sales and marketing at TSAM. Notable performances in the passenger segment included Urban Cruiser with 1 785 units, the relaunched Starlet (1 574) and Rumion with 562 sales. TSAM’s truck division Hino sold a total of 228 vehicles. Toyota’s niche luxury brand Lexus had an admirable run with ES (17), RX (13) and IS (10). “TSAM would like to thank its customers for the Toyota, Hino and Lexus models that were serviced at our dealer service centres last month. TSAM is also proud that it supplied no less than 1.4 million part pieces to our domestic dealers, while a further 295 000 pieces were shipped out of the country. “We are grateful to our dealers, customers and the entire Toyota workforce for positive and encouraging efforts from last month. As TSAM, we put implicit trust in our colleagues in Durban as they resuscitate the Prospecton Plant, as well as the incredibly strong dealer network that has always been the cornerstone of our business,” concludes Theron.
