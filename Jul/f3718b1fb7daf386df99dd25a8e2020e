POLOKWANE – They are arguably Limpopo’s fittest athletes. With sweat, blood and luckily no tears, CrossFit athletes came together in Polokwane last Saturday. It was time for the provincial qualifiers for The Fittest South Africa’s national event.      The national event will take place in Potchefstroom in August and is the pinnacle event for these athletes across the country. Various categories are contested which include teens, beginners, intermediates, advanced, masters and elite (RX) athletes.      CrossFit is a fitness regimen where athletes burn more calories than with a traditional workout. On Saturday, local athletes from all over the province had to show their mettle as they wanted to ensure their spot at the four-day event. The winners in each category made it through to the nationals and will give it their all to be crowned the best in the country in their respective categories.      RESULTS
