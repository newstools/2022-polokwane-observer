POLOKWANE – Mistry was 93 years old at the time of his passing on June 18 and he leaves behind his wife Manjulabhen, to whom he was married for 72 years, his four children Dineshbhai, Harshadbhai, Sheilabhen and Roshnibhen, six grandchildren and one great-grandchild. The stalwart was a pillar in the community and was instrumental in the erection of the Shree Gita Mandir Temple in Nirvana. He is remembered as a kind and gentle soul who sacrificed his life to better his family. The eldest son, Dr Dinesh J Mistry, shared that his father was very disciplined and had a sense of humour. “He had a strict morning routine which included yoga, exercise and walk then prayer. In the afternoons he would read spiritual books and cycle at home. Despite his age, he was still very strong and active until his fall,” he said. Mistry fell on February 10 and was admitted to ICU at the Milpark Hospital where he was cared for for 11 weeks. Thereafter he was admitted to an acute step-down facility for three-and-a-half weeks before he was discharged and brought home in Nirvana where he spent his final days with his family. The second-born son, Harshad J Mistry on behalf of the Mistry family expressed heartfelt thanks to all who supported them through this trying time. “Thank you for the love, prayers and providing the meals. This includes the Polokwane Muslim Welfare Foundation, the Hindu community, family, friends and assistance who serve the community. And thank you to the press for always covering his stories, we cannot begin to articulate our appreciation,” he said. Mistry will be missed dearly by his family, friends, members of the community and acquaintances. Mistry’s cremation ceremony was held at the Polokwane Independent Crematorium on June 21.
