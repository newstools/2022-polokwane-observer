POLOKWANE – There were 11 287 pregnant learners Limpopo between April 2021 and March 2022, according to the Minister of Basic Education (DBE), Angie Motshekga. These figures are for girls between the age of 10 and 19-years-old. Motshekga revealed the statistics last week in a written response to parliament’s portfolio committee on basic education following an inquiry by the Democratic Alliance Women’s Network Limpopo chairperson and Member of Parliament, Desiree van der Walt. Van der Walt said the DA will submit follow-up written questions to Motshekga to ascertain why there is a large discrepancy between the SAPS crime statistics and pregnant learners in the province. “The DBE has introduced the Basic Education Pregnancy policy in December 2021 through which schools will be compelled to submit a police report if a girl under the age of 16 falls pregnant,” she explained. Only 4 314 sexual offences (rapes, sexual assault, attempted rape and contact sexual offences) were reported in Limpopo, according to the crime statistics release for the same period. “This policy is linked with existing laws that protect our children and we are concerned that many cases are still not reported to the SAPS. As schools are compelled to report pregnancies of all girls, 16 or younger, and rapes of learners where educators are the alleged accused to the SAPS, we will ask detailed questions on each age group, how many of these cases were reported to the SAPS and what the consequences are for non-reporting,” a statement read. According to data from the Department of Health, Motshekga said the number of deliveries by girls in the time period was 24 230 (KwaZulu-Natal), 13 814 (Gauteng), 12 582 (Eastern Cape), 11 287 (Limpopo), 8 840 (Mpumalanga), 6 543 (Western Cape), 5 635 (North West), 4 444 (Free State) and 2 662 (Northern Cape), totalling 90 037 young mothers. “The DA believes that education unlocks opportunities and pregnant teenagers, many of whom were not only traumatised by the ordeal of rape and the stress of looking after newborn babies, are being deprived the opportunity of learning through no choice of their own,” van der Walt said.
