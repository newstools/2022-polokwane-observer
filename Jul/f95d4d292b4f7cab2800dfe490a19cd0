Home automation systems have been around for decades and are no longer only for the rich and famous. Instead, they are being installed in many middle-class homes, as the latest technology makes these appliances and gadgets steadily more affordable. From self-programming geyser thermostats to voice-activated television controls and washing machines that keep tabs on high and low power consumption times, there are state of the art appliances, devices, and gadgets designed to make your home tech-savvy. In addition to saving you time and effort, a highly automated home is bound to save you money in the long term. This is because most gadgets are low-energy users designed to help you save on energy and water costs and optimise functions like heating and cooling. The latest satellite technology enables many security features to be controlled from your smartphone, even if you are not at home. This means you can keep an eye on your garden and home even while you are at work or on holiday. Wireless home-control networking technology allows you to control heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) in your home from anywhere in the world using your smartphone. An automated home system can set your bedroom lights to brighten gradually in the morning so that you wake up naturally. You can also configure your lighting to turn on and off at set times so that you never again have to come home in the dark. It will also make your home appear occupied even when no one is home. There are dozens of new smart appliances on the market to make life easier. If you are planning a new home, installing home automation systems as part of the construction has many advantages. You will be able to include the cost in your home loan amount, and you won’t have the hassle of retrofitting once you have moved in. Writer : Sarah-Jane Meyer
