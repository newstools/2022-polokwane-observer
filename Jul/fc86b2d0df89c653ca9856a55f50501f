Teens are known for their highs and downs, but if your teen suddenly gets irritable, spends time with a new group of friends, or starts performing poorly in school, you may wonder if drugs are the cause. Drug testing your child at home may seem like a simple way to obtain an answer; after all, there are loads of at-home drug test kits available over-the-counter at pharmacies across SA. But, according to experts, at-home drug tests may not be the best option for several reasons. Urinalysis, or chemical examination of urine, is the most frequent at-home drug test. However, rapid at-home drug kits – even those that offer a combination of five different drug tests, have limitations, and parents must be aware of the following pitfalls: According to experts, there are better ways to discover what’s behind your child’s problematic behaviour. Instead, consult your child’s physician if you suspect your teen is abusing drugs. Your physician may be able to detect drug usage in your adolescent through an interview and a routine medical exam. Although you may wish to be there, the doctor should speak with your adolescent alone and in complete confidentiality. Don’t be anxious that you will be in the dark on a severe issue. Your physician will inform you if your teen is in imminent danger. Teens may regard parental drug testing at home as intrusive and a violation of their rights. You are not the police and certainly do not want to play that role in your child’s life. It may harm your relationship and bond, resulting in more behavioural issues. If you are concerned that your teen is abusing drugs or alcohol, you should get them evaluated by their primary care physician or other healthcare specialists. If it is confirmed that your teen has engaged in substance misuse, your healthcare professional will be familiar with the available resources for intervention and treatment services.
