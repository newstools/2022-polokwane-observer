POLOKWANE – During the event, Rotary Ann president Tina Gilfillan handed over the reins to Adrienne de Wit. Before De Wit took to the stage, Gilfillan recalled the projects they successfully organised throughout the year. “We had the Pink Flamingo Project, where a few flamingos visited residents’ gardens, who then paid for them to stay a while. We fixed some furniture that we donated to Our Home/Ons Tuiste. I would like to thank each and every Ann for their contribution to the success we achieved this year.” She also announced the Rotary Ann who deserved the Ann of the Year Award, who was Yvonne Joubert. After Gilfillan awarded Joubert for her hard work, De Wit stepped onto the podium and assured all of the Rotarians that the Anns will support them in all the ways expected of them. “The Rotary International theme for the year is ‘Imagine’. Imagine a world that deserves our best, where we get up each day knowing we can make a difference.” In his toast to the Anns, Richard Wilson said if you cannot respect your wife, you cannot respect anything. “The Anns helps us with everything, they were mainly involved with the renovation of Our Home, and we are thankful for their service.”
