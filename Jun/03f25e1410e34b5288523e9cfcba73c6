The Peugeot 208 beat out 24 other finalists in the prestigious competition to attract the most votes from the public. This accolade comes on the heels of the 208’s outgoing Car of the Year winner, the Peugeot 2008 SUV. The 2008 form part of one of the freshest model line-ups on the South African market today. The irresistible hatchback is both sporty and sensual – as customers have come to expect from Peugeot’s flair – and clearly resonated with the South African public, who recognised it for being just that. Agile and intuitive, the 208 packages the very best infotainment technology along with a host of other innovative tech that really sets it apart. With a choice of a 55kW 1.2-litre PureTech petrol engine or a feisty 96kW turbocharged version, there’s a 208 for every customer. Space, looks, futuristic ambience and comfort come standard. “We were immensely proud of the Peugeot 2008 SUV winning last year’s competition, along with Stellantis being considered the most admired car company in the country,” said Leslie Ramsoomar, managing director of Stellantis South Africa. “For the Peugeot 208 to be recognised by the South African public as their choice for this year is another proud moment for us, for which we are sincerely flattered.” The South African Guild of Motoring Journalists said the Peugeot 208 “goes against the grain in its delivery of being a compact hatchback… with distinctive styling and buttery smooth driving dynamics.” The 2022 Car of the Year title was judged by a qualified jury among 25 finalists in eight categories. The Peugeot 208 was a finalist in the compact category and was joined on the prestigious list by a second Peugeot, the recently introduced Landtrek. Source: QuickPic
