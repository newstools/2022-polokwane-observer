And we are not talking about playing “I spy” during the upcoming July school holiday trek. Kids nowadays require a fairly large dollop of tech time to keep them amused. Infotainment systems have become a key consideration in the car purchasing journey with the integration of rear-seat entertainment becoming increasingly desirable. Today’s infotainment-proficient cars offer a feast of entertainment, including for those in the rear. Take the Toyota Corolla Cross with enough options to keep everyone in the car entertained. The compact SUV’s infotainment system features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, USB ports front and rear, and passengers can connect to the in-car Wi-Fi to stream music, play games or watch movies. According to AutoTrader, on the used car market the Corolla Cross is listed for sale at R448 899 on average, with a 2022 registration year and 1 642km on the clock.  Then there’s the Volvo XC60 T8 with its new Android-powered infotainment system. The premium family SUV offers a suite of voice controlled Google apps and more (like games and movies) that can be downloaded. “Hey Google, play my songs” activates the playlist. Or listening to an audio book might be the preference.
And the kids can hook up their devices to the rear USB ports. The Swedish luxury car is listed on AutoTrader at R1 361 175 on average, with an average registration year of 2022 and mileage of 1 542km. But if screens in the rear are a must, large luxury SUVs like the Lexus LX 570, Range Rover SVR and Toyota Land Cruiser 300 fit the bill.  R1 152 675 is the average list price for a Lexus LX 570 with an average of 91 244km under its belt and an average registration year of 2016. R2 701 487 will snag you a Range Rover SVR with an average mileage of 20 929km and a 2020 registration year. Meanwhile, the Toyota Land Cruiser 300 with an average reading of 3 846km and a registration year of 2022, is listed on the used market at R2 270 315. Source: Nikki Chennells
