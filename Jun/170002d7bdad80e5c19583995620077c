POLOKWANE – The event took place at Meropa Casino and Entertainment World, where honourable guests from reputable organisations in and around Limpopo arrived to represent their companies and share a message of support. The ceremony was set to kick off the Limpopo law clinic project in Polokwane, with two other branches in Middelburg, Mpumalanga, and Parow, Western Cape. The expansion of the legal clinic is the result of a growing demand to serve people in the locations where Unisa institutions are situated. Despite being Africa’s largest university, the Unisa legal clinic was only operated at the Unisa Sunnyside Campus from a small-scale office, in comparison to other university law clinics in the country. Unisa, in joint effort with the college of law clinic leadership, resolved to expand the Unisa law clinic to all Unisa regional centres in the country. The project will be piloted at three Unisa regional centres. “We came here to celebrate the impact black legal practitioners can have in their own communities, because they know the history. We are here to give back to the communities that raised us,” event organiser Nyeleti Mashele said. “The opening of these Unisa law clinics in three provinces is to give people from marginalised communities free quality legal assistance,” the head of the Unisa law clinic, advocate Kgagudi Morota, said. “Our objectives are to provide quality assistance, educate communities and to train law graduates and introduce them in the legal fraternities to practice law,” added Morota.
