Did you know that your baby’s fingernails grow about 0.1 mm daily and faster in the summer? Keeping up with their constant growth might be a very challenging undertaking. Your baby’s nails have been developing since before she was born, so she may be ready for a manicure within the first week of her life (and every two or three days for the first three weeks until the nails stop growing so quickly. Use special baby scissors with rounded points, so you don’t accidentally poke her if she flinches while you’re working or a clipper specialised for the task. Some clippers have built-in magnifying glasses to assist you in getting a clear view. Top tip: Too timid to use baby nail clippers or scissors? Instead, use a baby-sized emery board. Peeling or gnawing your baby’s nail tips is generally not the best idea. Peeling may inadvertently remove too much of the nail, whilst nibbling may transmit your bacteria to her skin. Even though you’ll feel terrible, try not to worry if you accidentally draw blood; it happens to every well-meaning parent and manicurist! Do not put a bandage on the affected region (if it comes detached, it could pose a choking hazard). Applying mild pressure with a clean, lint-free cloth or gauze pad will quickly stop the bleeding. Many parents wrap their infants’ hands with mittens or socks to keep them from scratching their faces with their nails. However, as your baby develops over the next several weeks (and as you get more adept at nail trimming), it is advisable to give them ample time to explore their hands freely. If scratches continue to be an issue, we recommend limiting your baby’s covered time to when they are sleeping.
