The Department has however granted Polokwane Municipality permission to utilise paper ticketing as an interim measure,” he said. As one of the ways towards increasing ticket accessibility, the City will commence with sales of paper tickets on buses from June 1 as logistics around implementation of the ABT system in collaboration with the South African Roads Agency Limited unfold. “Although tickets will be sold on the buses, we advise passengers to purchase paper tickets beforehand to avoid delays during boarding,” Maubane added.
