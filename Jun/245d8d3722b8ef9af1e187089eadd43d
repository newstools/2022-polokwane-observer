Kadiwa reflected on the difficulties she had when she initally started in the industry, which included working capital and the criticism she faced and continues to face. “I am continously told that this industry is for men and that I will not make it but that criticism only motivates me more,” she said. Kadiwa said nothing demonstrates her hard work more than seeing her clients happy and her work being appreciated. “To see my clients delighted after finishing their house, knowing that we have given someone else a beautiful home, that is priceless to me,” she said. She added that the construction industry is not easy to work in as it demands a great deal of patience, passion and people skills because you are constantly engaging with clients. “You must be able to stand your ground and be financially secure to make it in this industry.” Kadiwa said her wish is for women to take the lead in the industry with comprehensive government support. “We should be able to share opportunities and collaborate with our male counterparts. That will bring about success,” she concluded.
