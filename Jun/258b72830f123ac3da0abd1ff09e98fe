POLOKWANE – Acrobat Candice Kekana said she chose to do acrobatics because it has improved her strength, stamina, flexibility, coordination, balance, discipline and focus. Acrobatics focuses more on body contortion and tricks that defy the center of gravity and involves the art of jumping, tumbling, and balancing. The Gr 5 learner from Bet-Shalom Christian School, who is also a ballerina, told the Polokwane Review that she started with acrobatics at the age of three but stopped for a while, only to return to the sport a few years later.

The two sporting codes complement each other well and I can feel  the difference in my posture when I go to my classes.” Candice recently won three medals from the Polokwane Acrobatics Sports Association during which she took part in level one to level five categories in the competition and came out on top. She beat all the other competitors in all of the levels and ended with the highest score. She then competed in regionals and came out first place in level five. She told the Review that she loves being an acrobat because it is a unique dance style that takes years to perfect and master. “I thank my Mom for supporting me throughout this journey and allowing me to do what I love doing and have passion for,” she concluded. Candice excels in both her academics as well as her extra mural activities and advised her peer group to never give up on their dreams and always follow their heart in whatever sport or activity they do.
