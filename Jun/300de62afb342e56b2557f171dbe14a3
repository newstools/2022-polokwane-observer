POLOKWANE – In his closing remarks at the ANC Limpopo’s recent 10th elective conference, re-elected chairperson Chupu Mathabatha commended voting delegates for the election os a collective that fuses age and gender. One of the youngest elected members of the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) of the ANC Limpopo is law graduate and Master of Law student, Jimmy Machaka (33). Born and raised in Sefene village in Botlokwa, Machaka matriculated at Phala High School and says his interest in politics emerged during his higher education days at the University of Venda (Univen). “I joined the South African Student Congress (Sasco) and derived interest in politics from the fact that I wanted to make my contribution to student struggles. I wanted to be counted among those to advance students’ interest. I led Sasco Univen in the Vhembe Region as Regional Secretary and Regional Chairperson Branch Secretary. I also led Sasco as the Provincial Secretary in Limpopo,” he said. Machaka went on to assume roles in the ANC Youth League (ANCYL) and has also served as spokesperson of the ANC Peter Mokaba region where he was equally part of the regional executive committee. He told the Polokwane Review that the journey of political activism is not without challenges. “As a student at Univen, I was suspended for championing students interests and that for me was a proud moment. I did not get suspended because my hand was found in student coffers and to me, those are great moments. I took the university to court against my suspension and I won.” Machaka’s suspension as Provincial Deputy Secretary of the ANCYL Limpopo was also overturned by the Polokwane High Court. He says he feels greatly honoured to be a PEC member and promises not to take the responsibility for granted. Machaka was also appointed spokesperson of ANC Limpopo on Wednesday (June 15). Machaka’s message to the youth is to make your mark and make a positive contribution in all opportunities that come your way.
