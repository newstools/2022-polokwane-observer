POLOKWANE – The soccer tournament that has all the flair, drama and goals that make grassroots tournaments popular in townships and rural areas will be back in September. The Solly Malatsi Legacy Foundation announced over the weekend that their annual tournament will return to Mankweng. A total of 32 soccer clubs from Seshego and Mankweng are set to battle it out for the R60 000 prize money, the floating trophy and gold medals. The foundation’s founder, Solly Malatsi, said the prize money is an increase from the R50 000 which was won by Makgato Football Club last year. “It is a sign of growth for the tournament. Teams that will take part in the tournament are from the amateur ranks and the aim is to give the players a platform to showcase their talent. Scouts from various Premier Soccer League clubs as well as National First Division clubs will be present throughout the tournament. We look forward to the spectacle.” He added the tournament is one of the major calendar events to uplift sport in our communities. “We want to invite companies with a key interest in social upliftment and community development to partner with us in this initiative,” Malatsi said. Those who want to enter a team or those who want to partner with the foundation may contact Danny Malatsi on 071 358 0728.
