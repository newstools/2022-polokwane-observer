The convener of the march, Lesetja Legodi, said they demand the reopening of Anglo operations in Twickenham, Mogalakwena, and the Polokwane Smelters which has, as a result, affected income streams for workers. Legodi explained they need the mines to benefit the communities they are located in, in the form of employment and business opportunities. He said they hope they submitted the memorandum for the last time because, according to him, they have submitted the memorandum on numerous occasions without receiving a response or commitments of change. Elton Thobejane. who spoke on behalf of Mejcon-SA, pleaded with the provincial department to stop giving mining rights to companies that subject workers to extreme work conditions. He said the department needs to urgently look at the operations of Anglo American and help ensure better a better and safer working environment for workers. Departmental regional manager Azwihangwisi Mulaudzi received the memorandum and asked the unions’ leadership to meet the department so they can deliberate on ways to intervene in relation to their demands. The memorandum of demands submitted to Anglo American was accepted by Tumelo Dilotsohle who promised that they will respond to demands in seven days.
