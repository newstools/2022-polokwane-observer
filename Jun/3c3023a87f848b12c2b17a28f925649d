It arrived just as she was revamping her new home and in the midst of creating spaces that reflected her unique needs. She immediately applied her designer eye to finding the ideal area in her home to fit the effortlessly-stylish AirDresser, as she knew it would become a much-used fixture. https://www.instagram.com/p/Cao3iabjaE3/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y With her followers on Instagram happily participating as sounding boards, she considered many options for its placement and even created renders to ensure it was located in the area that best fit her needs. Her biggest takeaway so far is that she can’t believe how often she uses it – “basically every day”. She puts her clothes in the AirDresser to refresh them before going out if they’ve been hanging in her cupboard for a while – and sometimes throws in a jacket that she’s worn the day before, that doesn’t really need a full wash. Showcasing the AirDresser’s many rewarding uses, whenever her friends hang out at her home, they leave their coats or shirts in it before they go out for the evening.
