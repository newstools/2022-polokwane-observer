POLOKWANE – Residents of Seshego Zone 5 are demanding for the Polokwane Mayor, John Mpe to address them over the demolition of structures in the area. The Polokwane Municipality went ahead with the demolition this morning (June 20) and said they have a court order to do so after the structures were erected in last week. Residents in the area, however, say the court order is interim and was issued in 2015 which they find questionable. They added that they would rather be harmed than have their structures removed. Earlier, residents formed a barricade around an excavator but were soon dispersed by rubber bullets. Two community leaders have also been arrested. Read more in this week’s Bonus Review.
