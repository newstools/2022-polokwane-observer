Rogers Monama are mentioned as those who would take over from Seaparo Sekoati (MEC of Treasury), Nandi Ndalane (MEC of Agriculture), Thandi Moraka (MEC of Sports, Arts and Culture), Polly Boshielo (MEC of Education) and Dr Dickson Masemola (MEC for Public Works and Infrastructure). At the tail-end of his Youth Day address in Lephalale, Mathabatha said he wanted to address people on social media. “We must understand that there is a difference between the ruling party and government. An election into the ruling party doesn’t guarantee a position into government. Stop peddling lies. I have my Exco and I don’t have a problem with them. The processes in government and those in the ruling party are different and I would prefer that we leave it like that,” he said.
