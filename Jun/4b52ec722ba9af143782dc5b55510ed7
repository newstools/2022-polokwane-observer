The locals did well at the recent Formula K karting races in Benoni. One young lady even went home smiling after baiting all the boys, too. Jamie Smith defended home honours in the premier gearbox class when he held Cape visitor Sebastian Boyd off for the win for the day. The two of them and the ever-improving Kian Grottis shared out the race wins, but Kian took a final race underweight exclusion to slip down the overall order. This left Divan Braak in third from DD2 Masters winner Eugene Brittz, Brandon Smith and Nicolas Spanoyannis. Philipe Chapat was unbeaten in the DD2 Vets. None of the three senior max winners won the day. That honour fell to consistent Roshaan Goodman, who pipped first and last race winners Karabo Malemela and Olerato Sekudu, Moosa Kajee, Kian Spies and Tristan Losch. Race 2 winner Muhammad Wally was excluded after also ending first in the final. Race 2 winner Wian Boshoff beat double winner KC Ensor Smith to high school junior max honours, with Muhammad, Jayden Goosen, Erich Heystek and Nico Vostanis in the chase.  Noah Cronje.Primary school action saw Aadam Kajee beat Kegan Martin two to one in under-13 mini max. Caleb Odendaal, Kent Swartz, Amani Kinyua and Durelle Goodman followed. GR Academy lass Emma Dowling’s first race win was enough for her to hold Rafael da Silva, Tayln Patel, Aiden Beaumont, Logan Billau and Johan Nolte off in under-11 micro max. And Noah Cronje blitzed baby Bambino from Brodi Dowling, Ronaldo Koen, Bophelo Molatlhegi, Diego Antunes and Luhan de Wet. One KZN round remains on June 19, before the real thing, round 2 of the Rotax Max South African National Karting Championship, back at Formula K on June 24 to 25. Source: MotorsportMedia
