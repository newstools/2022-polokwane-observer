POLOKWANE – The wheels on the Leeto La Polokwane buses are rolling daily as the integrated public transport system nears completion of phase 1. The system, which has faced a number of obstacles since its initial plans were announced, claims to be safe, reliable and convenient. Safety Last week, Leeto La Polokwane assistant manager for industry transition Malesela Maubane announced that passengers who make use of the bus service will be able to purchase paper tickets on the buses from June 1. The announcement, however, raised some safety concerns for residents who believe the buses are now an easy target for criminal activity such as theft. Maubane told Review that they have a plan in place to guarantee passengers’ safety and that the buses are monitored by surveillance cameras. “The municipality’s security services assist to ensure implementation of the overall safety and security plan as part of our integrated safety and security efforts. Besides the CCTV system, the city’s security services work with other law enforcement agencies in the case of emergencies such as robberies or shootings.” Convenience Leeto La Polokwane operates a scheduled service, with buses running every 30 minutes during peak and off -peak times. • Weekday (Monday-Friday) operations: 05:00 to 19:00.
• Saturday operations: 07:00 to 16:00.
• Sunday and public holiday operations: 08:00 to 14:00. The implementation of paper ticket sales has raised alarm that the sales will affect the schedules, but Maubane assured residents that the process is efficient and monitored to deliver on the brand’s promise of “a scheduled bus service which is safe, reliable, and convenient”. To enhance customers’ experiences on the system and to make planning a journey simple, Maubane announced a Leeto La Polokwane mobile application. He explained the app is currently at a commissioning stage, and will initially only be available for download on the Android platform. A date for the release is yet to be announce. “The iPhone Operating System (iOS) version should be available for download by September. With the app, clients will be able to access bus routes and timetables, and in the future, they will be able to plan their journey, purchase tickets, load travel cards, access interactive route maps and be able to chat with our customer agents to provide feedback.” Routes Leeto La Polokwane Phase 1A bus operations cover routes:
• F1 (Flora Park),
• F4B (Nirvana),
• TE4 (Madiba Park/Zone 1)
• TE5B (Zone 2). “Plans for the future include the implementation of Phase 1B, which will cover the rest of Flora Park, Nirvana, Westenburg and Seshego routes. Phase 2 (Moletjie), Phase 3 (Mankweng) and Phase 4 (Koloti/Aganang) routes are part of plans towards expanding the service, wherein priority for implementation will be dependent on council determination and future spatial developments within the municipality.” Prices and problems There is no plan to increase the current fares in the near future, despite the rising fuel prices. Fares:
• Seshego to CBD: R10 for a single trip, R20 for a return, and R100 for a multi-journey ticket with 10 trips.
• Flora Park and Nirvana to CBD: R6 for a single trip, R12 for a return trip, and R60 for a multi-journey trip. As taxi fares continue to increase due to the rising fuel prices, Maubane was asked if the price differences will lead to more unhappiness about routes with taxi operators. He assured residents that they do not foresee any problems in this regard. “Government’s fundamental objective in implementing the Integrated Public Transport Networks such as the Leeto La Polokwane, is to transform the public transport sector in the country. Implementation of Phase 1A of the Polokwane IPTN has thus benefitted taxi operators from the Flora Park Pietersburg, Seshego Polokwane and Westenburg taxi associations and they have since formed a Vehicle Operating Company that runs bus operations.” Maubane added that the taxi industry is one of the city’s valued stakeholders as it undertakes transport planning functions, and that working closely with taxi associations operating within its jurisdiction remains a priority. “Furthermore, due to limited Leeto bus supply, taxis still have a role to play to meet the transport demand on the Phase 1A routes. There are taxis that operate on these routes as the Leeto fleet only caused a partial withdrawal. The buses replaced the demand catered for by 123 minibus taxis on the Phase 1A routes,” he concluded.
