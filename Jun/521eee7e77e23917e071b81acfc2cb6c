The event will take place at the Prison Break Market in Johannesburg on June 4 and 5. Fans will enjoy various activities inclusive of test driving the new Taigo. There will also be a free barber experience, glam make-up makeovers and, for the boldest at heart, a free real tattoo.  Visitors will be able to explore the digitally-savvy Taigo through the Virtual Reality experience and also stock up on all must-have Volkswagen Taigo lifestyle accessories. All guests visiting the Taigo Junction will stand the chance to win Taigo adventures by visiting and tagging in at various Taigo Junction activities. Taigo derives its name from a combination of ‘tiger’ and ‘Taiga’, which is a forest in the Northern Hemisphere.
The Taigo will join the Volkswagen T-Cross and T-Roc as Volkswagen’s trio of compact SUVs in the A0 SUV segment.  The new Taigo impresses with its trendy crossover body style, raised seating position and pioneering connectivity. Numerous assistance systems guarantee comfort and a high level of safety for all passengers. With full LED headlights, a digital cockpit and the latest generation of infotainment systems, the Taigo sets high technology standards in its class. This VW will also be available with Volkswagen’s popular tilting and sliding panoramic sunroof. Registration for the Taigo Junction event is free at: https://vwtaigojunction.com/ Source: MotorPress
