LIMPOPO – Students from poor backgrounds who attended the Thusa Skills Development Centre received their hard-earned certificates during a ceremony held at Louis Trichardt in the centre hall last Friday. The programme was held in partnership with the AgriSeta and Sasseta and students were trained as tailors, shoemakers, bookkeepers, florists and nail technicians/beauticians. The manager at Thusa Skills Development Centre, Lufuno Matodzi urged all students to make the best of themselves and share the knowledge they had acquired with others. “Our aim is to equip the community with the much-needed knowledge and skills. We are happy that we are now making a visible contribution towards the eradication of illiteracy in our communities,” she said. “I thank the students for having completed the programme and for not giving up. This shows how committed and dedicated you are,” she remarked. She urged students to continue doing well to succeed in life. “If you do not have the right attitude, hard work will be a burden to you. All good things you have achieved are because of your attitude.” The guest speaker, Macreey Ramuhala, manager of Vhumatshelo Farming Crops, encouraged students who have shown commitment in skills development. “I believe that the students who graduated will go far in life. I am also happy that no one has dropped out of the programme.” Dzivhuluwani Munzhelele said she benefitted from attending the programme, “Previously, they were just sitting at home being idle, but the centre came to their rescue. It has brought light into our lives”.
