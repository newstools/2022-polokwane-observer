Thorisho’s brother, Karabo, told the Polokwane Review that the last half of the day’s proceedings left the family saddened and unsure as “the probation officer seemed to be easily swayed by defence lawyers.” “We feel the judge will hand down a harsh sentence having heard what she had to say today but we await the official sentencing tomorrow before we give an official statement,” he said. Judge Violet Semenya, before court was adjourned for the day, said the matter has been on the roll for too long and asked for it to be concluded by tomorrow. All bail conditions remain.
