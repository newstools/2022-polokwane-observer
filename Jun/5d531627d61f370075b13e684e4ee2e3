Triple wins proved to be the order of the day, headed by Joseph Oelz leading Sebastian Boyd and Kyle Visser home in that order in all three premier class DD2 races. Jared Jordan was one of the drivers to turn that tide as he beat race 2 and 3 winner Conor Hughes in the first Masters race with Marco Viegas, Andrew Thomas, Gil Simoes, Johan Hamman and Steve Beaumont in chase
National main circuit Polo Cup rivals, Charl Visser and Tate Bishop were the only other drivers to share out the heat wins as Visser beat Bishop two races to one in Senior Max, with Global Touring Car racer and SA Formula 1600 champion Andrew Rackstraw sharing seconds and thirds with Bishop, and Matthew Wadeley, Ethan Stier, Jaden Jacobs and Gio Hartman next. Reese Koorzen meanwhile left his high school Junior Max rivals Ethan Deacon, Ashton Repsold, Joshua Smit and Jude Stuart to fight it out for the positions. In primary school action, Sabelo Ntuli took two heat wins to take u/13 Mini Max from Matthew Chiwara, race 1 winner Keagan Beaumont, with Jordon Wadeley, Dale Hobbs and Tyler Repsold in pursuit. Michael Danks beat Matthew Roach in all three u/11 Micro Max races as Zach McAuley pipped Aiden Beaumont, Liam Wharton and Nicolas Lennox for third. And Zac Boshoff cleaned up in a full baby Bambino field over Michael O’Mahoney, Zach McAuley, Carter Cedras and Logan Roehrig and Liam Wharton. One more KZN regional remains coming Sunday June 19, before Rotax Max karters from around the country converge on Formula K in Benoni, Gauteng for the second of four rounds of the South African National Rotax Max Challenge.
