LIMPOPO – Gymnast Angel Mulaudzi has her heart set on producing many more gymnasts from the rural areas. Angel recently started Wavhudi Gymnastics in Thohoyandou as she wanted to give young people in rural areas the opportunity to get trained in gymnastics. “I have seen impressive talent locally and decided to start my own gymnastics club. Gymnastics teaches one to work hard, be disciplined and stay focused. “The sport also helps with social interactions as you get to know and accept gymnasts from different backgrounds. Lastly, gymnastics is fun!” You might also want to read: Capricorn’s gymnastics star She invites young people who are interested in gymnastics to join them. “We plan to make this sport big in our area and we want everyone to participate. If we get sponsors in the future, we will reward the gymnasts to strengthen their spirits.” Mulaudzi extended her invite to be part of the club to business people as she hopes they will support her club with sponsorships. The second-year student BSc sport and exercise student at the University of Venda participated in the SA Gymnastic Games in 2021. She returned home with five gold medals. Growing up in rural Limpopo, she knows how scarce sporting resources can be. Mulaudzi hopes to help other promising gymnasts to reach their dreams and to produce world champions from the Vhembe area. “There is so much talent in the rural villages just waiting to be explored. We must nurture it, because if we don’t, it will be lost forever,” she said.
