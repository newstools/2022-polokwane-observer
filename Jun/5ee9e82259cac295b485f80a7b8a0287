Accidental poisoning is most common in children under the age of five, with cases peaking in those aged one to three years. It is critical for parents to be aware of the various poisons children may be exposed to in their own homes. Household poisons are compounds found in your home that can be dangerous – and in some cases even life-threatening –  if consumed, inhaled, or touched. Household poisons include medicines, detergents, cleaning goods, toiletries, and garden and pool chemicals. These are some common household items that can result in serious harm to a child: It only takes a few seconds for an unsupervised child to get hold of dangerous cleaning agents. Do not make poisons easily accessible to your children. To keep your child safe, store poisons in their original containers or use child-resistant packaging, keep poisons in elevated cabinets, and keep poisons away from food storage areas to decrease the possibility of a child accidentally consuming such products. After using chemicals or cleaners, immediately dispose of them. Consider cleaning chemicals that are less hazardous. A solution of vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, for example, cleans most surfaces. Know the names of the plants in your house and garden. Remind your child not to eat plants, seeds, or berries, they find outside and keep an eye on them. While prevention is essential for keeping children safe from common household chemicals, accidents do happen, and having a plan in place is critical.
