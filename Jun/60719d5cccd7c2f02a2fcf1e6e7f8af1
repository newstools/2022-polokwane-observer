Start with a superhero fiction series about a man who fights for peace at any cost. Then watch a British police series about a Detective Inspector who is promoted to homicide but realises instantly she is a token hire. Or follow a fan who manoeuvres her way into a seasoned anchor’s newsroom but soon confronts the dark side of ambition. In this superhero series that takes us back into the DC Universe, patriotic assassin Peacemaker and his ragtag A.R.G.U.S black ops squad must eliminate parasitic creatures that threaten the future of humanity. Watch Peacemaker season 1 on Showmax.  DI Ray follows DI Rachita Ray, who is promoted to join a homicide investigation. However, she’s told the murder is a ‘Culturally Specific Homicide’, which makes her suspect she’s been chosen for her ethnicity rather than her ability. Rachita sticks to the case, determined to find the killer by delving deep into the dangerous world of organised crime, as well as calling out the obvious biases her colleagues are bringing to the investigation. Catch DI Ray season 1 from June 9 on BritBox.  A prominent news host watches her glitzy life unravel when an ambitious intern begins to sabotage her at work and sow discord in her marriage. Watch As the Crow Flies on Netflix.
