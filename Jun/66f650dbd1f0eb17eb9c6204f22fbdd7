POLOKWANE – All of the excitement took place at the Moths headquarters on Saturday, offering something to do and enjoy for everyone who attended. The winning potjie was the tomato broth of Bosveld Hotel made by Annelize Booysen and Michaela de Beer, followed by Johan Oosthuizen, Collin Edwards and Riaan Kloppers of the Rustic Pot team. The third position was awarded to the Road Kill Surprise Team, which consisted of Ben Vorster, Jo-Anne Vorster, Heinrigh Scheepers and Ben Vorster Jr. The teams ignited their fires mid-morning to prepare and cook their potjies, as visitors were allowed to make the rounds and buy plates filled with delicious food around lunch time, and thereby making a contribution towards charity. The Road Kill Surprise Potjiekos Team invited visitors to have a peek at their beef, lamb and boerewors potjie that was served with mealie carrots, baby potatoes and mushrooms. Another potjie that got people’s attention was the oxtail and vegetable delicacy containing a secret gravy of the Moonshine Bikers, who are Ian Fox and Derek Benadé. Visitors gladly supported the stalls where refreshments were served while Archie Shamley provided entertainment. Members of the South African Special Forces Association exhibited memorabilia and entertained visitors with their recollections of events during the bush war. Items were also auctioned off and the proceeds will go towards charities. Old Bill Anton le Roux was happy with the support given by members of the community and said that it was another opportunity for the Moths to meet new friends and to create awareness about the organisation’s activities. “Our aim is still to assist Moths and their families, but we also reach out to schools and charities where there is a need,” Le Roux said.
