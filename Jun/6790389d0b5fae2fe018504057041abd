The Provincial Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe has sent a stern warning against perpetrators of gender-based violence. “The arrest of the suspect should send a clear message to those who victimise vulnerable individuals, especially women and children, that they will be hunted down and brought to book. It is upon everyone to protect our elders to avoid disturbing incidents like this from happening,” Hadebe said.
