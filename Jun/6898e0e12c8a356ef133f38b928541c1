The men then tied up one of the nurses before fleeing the scene in the car,” he said. The vehicle was later recovered by members of the South African Police Service. Ramathuba said she is disappointed by criminal activity targeting clinics in the province. “These thugs are reducing the gains that we have put together as a department to have 24-hour service clinics. Our staff have dedicated themselves to saving the lives of others and as a society, we should be ashamed of these barbaric acts,” she said. Ramathuba has dispatched a team of psychologists to provide psychological support to the victims.
