Did you know that thousands of children are treated in hospital emergency rooms each year after ingesting button or lithium coin batteries? Both battery kinds are compact, shiny, and visually appealing to children. And both can cause serious injury or death if lodged in a child’s nose or ear or swallowed. Although button and lithium coin batteries are not identical, both are small, circular batteries used to power various electrical gadgets. They are found in a variety of home items, including remote controls. Some games and toys, as well as flashing shoes, apparel, and jewellery designed for children, may also contain button batteries or lithium coin batteries. These batteries contain potentially lethal components, including lithium, zinc silver, or manganese. If a coin lithium button battery gets stuck in a child’s throat, the saliva triggers an electrical current. This causes a chemical reaction that can severely burn the oesophagus in as little as two hours. Damage can continue even after the battery is removed. Repairing the damage is painful and can require a feeding tube, breathing tubes and multiple surgeries. Batteries stuck in the ear or nose can cause severe damage to structures, including the eardrum and nasal septum. Chemical burns can cause infections and, in some circumstances, irreversible impairments in breathing, smell, and hearing. Parents and caregivers should not assume that all home battery-powered products are safe for children to use. These batteries are often easily accessible in numerous devices or can be dislodged if the product is dropped. Symptoms of coin-sized button battery ingestion may be similar to other childhood illnesses, such as coughing, drooling, lethargy, loss of appetite, stomach cramps, and a sore throat. In some cases, children may vomit fresh, bright red blood. If you suspect your child has ingested a button battery, seek medical attention immediately.
