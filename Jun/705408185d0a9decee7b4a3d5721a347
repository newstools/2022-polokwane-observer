LIMPOPO – Transport and Community Safety MEC Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya is concerned by the increase of early morning crashes and accidents reported over the weekend. Lerule-Ramakhanya urged motorists to adhere to the laws of the road after seven people were killed in two separate incidents thus far this weekend. Transport media liaison officer Mike Maringa said in a statement that six people were confirmed dead following a horrific incident on the R71. “The accident involved two sedans and occurred near Letsitele-Letaba Junction outside Tzaneen in the Mopani district. It is believed that on Saturday evening the driver of a speeding sedan lost control of the vehicle and collided head-on with an oncoming sedan before the vehicle burst into flames,” he explained and said the road was closed following the incident. Maringa added that security personnel from the nearby filling station pulled the driver out of the burning vehicle. “The driver, however, passed away while all five occupants in the other sedan were also certified dead on the scene.” Reckless driving has been cited as a possible cause of the incident. “The other fatal accident was also reported in the Mopani district. A 19-year-old male passenger was killed when the driver of the SUV they were travelling in, lost control of the vehicle and it overturned on the R40,” he explained.
