Start with a comedy about a tech-support employee who becomes the unwitting messenger of God. Then watch a twist-filled crime thriller series that follows a Northern Irish police officer. Or opt for a drama about a highly contagious virus that eliminates most of the human race and ties together some of the survivors in strange and wondrous ways. Mid-level tech support employee Clark Thompson falls in love with co-worker Amily Luck at exactly the same time he becomes the unwitting messenger of God, filling his world with roller skating, a lake of fire and an impending apocalypse. Watch God’s Favorite Idiot from June 15 on Netflix. DCI Tom Brannick is a stony-faced Belfast detective called to investigate a prominent former IRA member’s disappearance. The case is soon linked to a set of abductions/ presumed murders from 1998. The ‘Goliath’ case, we soon learn, has a rather personal connection to Brannick. Catch season 1 of Bloodlands on BritBox.        A post-apocalyptic saga spanning multiple timelines, telling the stories of survivors of a devastating flu as they attempt to rebuild and reimagine the world anew while holding on to the best of what’s been lost. Station Eleven is now on Showmax.
