Do you have concerns about bottle-feeding your baby? The good news is that most babies figure out how to suck from a bottle nipple with relative ease, especially if you begin using bottles early on. Here is everything you need to get started bottle-feeding your baby, whether you’ll be using formula exclusively, combining it with breastfeeding, or using bottles to serve up expressed breast milk. If you intend to bottle-feed your infant, you should begin immediately after birth. However, if you are breastfeeding, it is recommended that you wait around three weeks before introducing a bottle. Not because of “nipple confusion” (which is questionable), but because your breasts may not be stimulated enough to produce an adequate milk supply. Despite the fact that bottle-feeding is often simple to initiate, issues can occasionally arise. These are a few common problems that are usually easy to resolve. She may have gas in her stomach. If she appears uncomfortable or turns away from the bottle but is not full, try burping her to help her expel the air bubbles. First, ensure that she is indeed asleep. She may be sucking so happily that it appears she has departed for La-La Land, but in reality, she is only taking her time sucking down her bottle’s contents. If she has truly fallen asleep, gently rouse her sufficiently to complete the meal. Try removing some of her clothing, tickling her feet, burping her, rearranging positions, or even changing her nappy. Cold congestion can make it difficult for your baby to suckle. Utilise a cool-mist humidifier, over-the-counter saline drops, and a suction bulb to assist in clearing some of the mucus, and continue to offer bottles as usual. She may have an intolerance or allergy to cow’s milk protein, the principal constituent in the majority of newborn formula. Consult her paediatrician if she exhibits symptoms such as crying after eating, poor feeding, wheezing, digestive issues, wet or puffy eyes, or a rash. The remedy may be as simple as changing your baby’s formula to one that he or she can accept. Choosing the ideal bottles and pacifiers for your baby can be difficult due to the number of available alternatives. Ask friends for recommendations, read product reviews, and conduct research, but also be willing to experiment. Ultimately, the key to selecting the ideal bottle-nipple mix is discovering your child’s preferences. Some infants favour a certain nipple shape or bottle variety, while others are not choosy. Try a couple of alternatives before stocking up.
