POLOKWANE – The MEC for Health, Dr Phophi Ramathuba said she wants her department to be known as the department of health not the department of disease and said she was happy about the turn-out at the department’s health and mental health wellness day. Ramathuba led employees from various districts in physical excercise and various sports activities at Noordeland High School under the theme ‘Be nice with your mind’. Ramathuba said the day aimed to promote healthy living in the workplace and activites included aerobics, netball and soccer. “I’m finally walking the talk. It is painful to be invited by other departments to talk about living a healthy lifestyle and the importance of physical activity when I don’t do it at home. We are the department of health, not the department of disease,” she said. Ramathuba added that the department shouldn’t only intervene when people are sick but intervene when they are healthy too. “The best way to do that is to be an example to others and show them how it’s done,” she said.
