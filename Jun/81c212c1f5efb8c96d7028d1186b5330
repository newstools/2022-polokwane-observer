The decorative arts auction comprises two sessions and additionally features a diverse consignment of furniture, glassware and painting from Wilbur and Niso Smith Foundation, as well as a highly attractive offering of English, Continental and South African interior pieces. “South African collectors have shown strong appetite for modern and contemporary design furniture, with significant sales recorded at auction locally in the past three years,” says Vanessa Phillips, Strauss & Co’s joint managing director and head of the decorative arts department. “This auction includes a cross-section of furniture pieces by African, American, Asian and European designers, which we have complemented with outstanding pieces in silver, glass and ceramic.”  Highlights from the introductory Design session include a leather lounge chair by Malian designer Cheick Diallo (estimate R9 000 – 12 000), a pair of Prosim Sedni/ Papillon armchairs by Czech designer Borek Sipek (estimate R20 000 – 25 000) and a Rocking Armchair Rod base chair, abbreviated to RAR, by American designers Charles and Ray Eames (estimate R7 000 – 9 000). The catalogue also features a rare auction appearance of a nickel-plated steel mesh ‘How High the Moon’ armchair by Japanese designer Shiro Kuramata (estimate R80 000 – 100 000).
