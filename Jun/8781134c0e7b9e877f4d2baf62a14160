Along with a fuel price increase, the prices of basic goods have equally increased.

With the JSE’s All Share index having lost another 2% on Monday (June 13), economists are warning of another possible fuel price hike. With this is mind, the Polokwane Review approached both the Mankweng Taxi Association (MTA) and Seshego Polokwane Taxi Associations (SPTA) to find out whether they would be increasing taxi fare and when commuters can expect it . MTA spokesperson Frans Kgasago told Review that commuters should prepare for a fare hike that will be put into effect some time this month. “Although we cannot say what the the increase will look like, we can promise that the hike will be manageable because we understand the high cost of living is affecting our commuters so we can’t overcharge them,” he said. It currently costs R24 for one to catch a taxi from Polokwane to Mankweng. The Seshego Polokwane Taxi Association said they are yet to determine when a fare increase will happen. SPTA spokesperson Ally Hammer Mothiba said the executive consists of 10 members who will meet soon and the issue will possibly be included in the agenda. “We are feeling the burn that is brought on by the high cost of living and fuel prices and we will meet soon to decide on a way forward,” he said. Mothiba told Review that they will inform ‘the mass’ once the the issue is discussed by the executive. This includes other association members and taxi owners who will get an opportunity to weigh-in on the proposed price hike before all leaders can agree. “The executive meeting will happen soon,” he said.
