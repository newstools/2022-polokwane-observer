Just like you pack away your summer shorts and bikinis and bring in the jerseys and boots, so too should you update and swap out your skincare products to give your skin the protection it needs in the dryer, colder air. Fundamentals Skincare are here to help us reset our regime while getting all the goodness we need to keep our skin moisturised and healthy this winter in these five steps: Step 1: Cleanser. Opt for a cleanser that contains Aloe Vera to help your skin heal from any damage caused by the colder weather. Not only a popular household plant, Aloe is also excellent for moisturising the skin while helping soothe acne, eczema, and sunburn. Step 2: Toner. Baobab oil is a rich source of omega fatty acids that fights inflammation, making it a great choice for sensitive or inflamed skin. Baobab’s anti-inflammatory properties soothe irritation and can even help with skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis. Using a toner that has Baobab and is alcohol-free will help you achieve smooth, soft, hydrated skin with reduced inflammation and improved barrier functioning. Step 3: Serum. We love a serum containing Vitamin C or Hyaluronic Acid, especially in winter. For all skin types, L-ascorbic acid is the most potent form of vitamin C and can be the most beneficial. Hyaluronic Acid will give your skin a boost of hydration and is also suitable for all skin types. Step 4: Moisturiser. This step is absolutely crucial for your face and body. Choose a face cream containing ceramide for ultimate hydration, as age and environmental triggers reduce ceramides, which we need for the skin to work properly. Look for a body cream/butter with Niacinamide which is effective for hydration and managing the environmental impact on the skin. Step 5: Last but not least – SPF. Even if the sun isn’t shining, you need to protect your skin from those damaging UV rays. Always opt for a sun protection factor of at least 30.
