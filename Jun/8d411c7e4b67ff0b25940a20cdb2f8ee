POLOKWANE – Mothiba was diagnosed with lupus in 2017, but already started to show symptoms in 2007. She explained that lupus is a chronic condition where one’s immune system is hyperactive and starts to attack healthy tissue and/or itself. Lupus is also known as the great imitator as it mimics a lot of medical conditions. “It took 10 years for me to be diagnosed correctly. In the meantime I was treated for the symptoms I presented individually. I’ve also been diagnosed with chronic pain and fatigue, rheumatoid arthritis, polycystic ovary syndrome, fibromyalgia, minor lupus induced epilepsy and invisible disabilities,” she said. During her treatment for lupus, she had to undergo blood and platelet infusions, chemotherapy infusion and take chemotherapeutic tablets, steroids, schedule six painkillers, antidepressants, sleeping pills, immunotherapy, physiotherapy and hydrotherapy. The mental effects of all these treatments could not be ignored. “Anxiety and depression happen to be a part of lupus symptoms. It wasn’t easy not to be able to do things my peers did and I felt alienated, lonely and I eventually developed poor mental health,” she added. Mothiba said that after her lupus diagnosis she got even worse and she didn’t know anyone else with her condition, which made her feel alone. She explained her compassionate medical team and support from family and friends helped her through her difficult time. She joined support groups and went for therapy which improved her mental health a lot. “One thing I learned on my journey is that it is better to advocate for ourselves as warriors than to have people who aren’t diagnosed themselves on the front line,” she said. Mothiba founded the M2 Foundation for Chronic Illnesses, which aims to educate society on illnesses like lupus and engage stakeholders to be more accommodating to people with such illnesses.
