The fifth event in the iDube Rotax Max Championship on Sunday June 19 prepared drivers for this weekend’s Formula K event in Benoni. Jozi visitor Jamie Smith trotted to a top-class DD2 triple to take the day from top masters man Jonathan Pieters. He bounced back from a first-heat issue to take second in the following two races. Nicholas Wuite and Riley Horner tussled all day, with Wuite taking third overall by all of a point, ahead of masters quartet Shane Foley, Alistair Mingay, Bev and Richard van Heerden, with the missus taking that place on a countback following a tie on the day. Troy Snyman put the finishing touches to his senior max national preparation with a dominant triple victory to take the day from Yifan Li, upcountry comeback kid Delon Thompson, Juandré Nel, Hannah Daniel and Shrien Naidoo. Uzair Khan beat Dhivyen Naidoo two high school junior max races to one to take the day, with Jonno Wilson third from Dylan Watkins, Maahir Wahab and Ndzalo Khoza. Travis Mingay made no mistakes as he defeated a field of local and upcountry under-13 mini max rivals to take the triple over Harry Rowe, Matthew Chiwara, Sabelo Ntuli, Troy Pieterse and Sebastian Geldenhuys and carry KZN’s hopes high up to that national. Jozi visitor Rafael de Sousa took under-11 micro max triple over Ryan Falconer and Yashlan Chetty, and Bophelo Molatlhegi took baby bambino honours from Teiyan Chetty, Kayden Pistauer and Adriaan Steyn. In other action, Allan John Rice took the max masters triple to take the day from Alan Johnston and Robin Jeffrey, and Peter John Garbutt took all three four-stroke sprint wins from Andrew and Kyle Nivison. All eyes are now firmly on that Benoni Rotax Max National this weekend before the KZN season continues with a pre-national at iDube on July 10. That is a week before the double-header third National and Rotax Max African Open there on July 15 to 17. Source: MotorsportMedia
