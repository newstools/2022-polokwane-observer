LIMPOPO – A police sergeant stationed at the Benoni police station in Gauteng is one of two men arrested in connection with the kidnapping of 31-year-old Refiloe Malope. Malope was allegedly taken by force by two suspects who were seen shoving her into the boot of a sedan in the Kgaphamadi village under the Hlogotlou policing area on May 9. At the time, it was reported that Malope was approached by one of the suspects under the pretence that he needed assistance as his vehicle broke down in the village. When the two arrived at the car, the second suspect emerged and the two forced her into the boot of the car. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the sergeant and his accomplice (39) were nabbed during a joint intelligence driven operation conducted by the Limpopo Tracking Team, the Provincial Organised Crime Unit and Hlogotlou detectives. “The sergeant was arrested while at work on Tuesday (June 21) and his accomplice was apprehended at his hideout on Wednesday (June 22) in the Apel policing precinct,” Mojapelo said. He added that the team is currently following up on information that the suspects may have murdered Malope and dumped her body into a discontinued ventilation mine shaft in Benoni. “The Benoni SAPS Search and Rescue Unit and the Department of Mineral Resources have been requested to assist in these efforts. The operation will commence as soon as the necessary equipment to access the shaft are made available,” Mojapelo said. The duo are expected to appear in the Nebo Magistrate’s Court this morning (June 23) on charges of kidnapping and obstructing the course of justice.
