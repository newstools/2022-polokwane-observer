POLOKWANE – The competition took place from June 7-10 at the Durban Exhibition Centre with the theme ‘Ratcheting up the production of 21st Century Artisans’. The four-day competition welcomed students from universities of technology, various employers and colleges across the country to battle it out in various skills categories for the number one spot, which would secure them an opportunity to participate in the international competition. Maredi Davidson Tshelane and Jack Shirindza collectively obtained the second position in mechatronics and Lesedi Moswa finished third in water technology. They represented the province under the guidance of their mentors Boitumelo Shokane, lecturer for chemical plant operations/process plant operations, and Johannes Mamabolo, lecturer for mechatronics. Shokane explained the WorldSkills organisation is meant to provide new skills to the youth through the competition. Mamabolo said preparation for the competition was not easy because they faced a few challenges such as strikes at the college. He commended his team for the hard work they put in to prepare for the competition. “We would also like to thank the college for the support. Whenever we complained, they were there for us,” he said. Joseph Isaac Mfopa, the acting deputy principal, said the college supports the teams with whatever they need. “We support them fully and they must list any complaints they have so that we can address them,” he said. The students said they are grateful to have had the opportunity to represent the province and are happy with the outcome of the competition.
