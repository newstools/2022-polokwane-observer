Earlier, the court heard from the Probation Officer, Malesela William Raphela who gave a report on two of the four accused, Motimele Vincent and Michael Teffo. He told the court that the two, who were minors at the time, were first-time offenders and have denied responsibility and said they both showed no remorse when assessed. Raphela also told the court that the Themane family have pleaded for the court to pass a sentence that will honour their son’s memory. Themane’s father, Mahlapahlapane Thema was quoted to have said that the passing of his son and the widely circulated video, left the family traumatized. Themane’s mother, Maria was quoted to have said her son’s death has left her emotionally traumatised and asked the court to sentence the accused to set an example. Raphela will report on the other two accused when court resumes.
