This traditional origami cat is a fun craft you can do with your child this weekend. This origami puppet has a lovely cat face, but by designing a different face or folding the ears differently, you can make various animal faces, such as a bat or dog. Decorate these miniature faces with glitter, sequins, and ribbons for a fun craft activity. Although this is a kid-friendly project, the folds may require the assistance of an adult. Step 1: Fold the paper in half, starting with the white side facing you. Make a diamond shape with your paper, with the lower corner facing towards you.
Fold the paper in half vertically (from left to right) and then unfold. There will be a crease in the middle of the paper. Fold the paper in half horizontally after that (from the top corner to the bottom corner). Keep it folded in this manner. Step 2: The right corner should be folded down to the bottom centre point. Fold the left corner all the way down to the bottom centre. Then, fold the right flap up from the centre. Position the flap at a 90-degree angle with the right edge. Step 3:Fold the left flap in the same way the right flap was folded. From the bottom part to the top point, fold one layer up. For the time being, keep one layer down. Overturn the puppet. Step 4: The left and right edges should now be folded inward. Maintain a clean fold. Fold the bottom section all the way up to the top point. Step 5: The top middle point should be folded down. Fold the upper middle point’s layers all the way down. Make the folds as crisp as possible. Overturn the puppet. Step 6: Draw the eyes, nose, whiskers, and mouth with a marker. Allow the puppet to glide onto your child’s finger by opening the bottom. To watch a YouTube tutorial on how to make your finger puppet, click below. Credit: Paper Folds – Origami & Crafts!
