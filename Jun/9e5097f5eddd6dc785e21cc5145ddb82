POLOKWANE – The final seven competitors were chosen from the previous three competitions and the event was a winner-takes-all final. They competed in three categories: Tyre drag and flip, farmer’s carry and sandbag squat. Each competitor put in an incredible performance from the first challenge, but Marco Neophytou and Dewald van Heerden were the frontrunners for the title. Van Heerden left all other competitors in the dust in the tyre drag and also won the second event, a 80kg sandbag squat for maximum repetitions, with flying colours. He had a comfortable lead going into the third event which was a timed tyre flip. On the other hand, Neophytou showed he wasn’t finished yet and snatched the win from Van Heerden in under a second. Neophytou made a massive comeback in the fourth event which was a crucifix hold and going into the final event, Van Heerden had only a one-point lead over Neophytou. In order for Neophytou to win, he had to finish first in the fifth and final event, a max farmer’s carry, and Van Heerden third. That is exactly what happened and Neophytou was crowned as the 2022 Pieter Theron Strongman Champion with Van Heerden in second place and Otto Muller in third.
