Since 4000 BC, swaddling has been practised in various forms worldwide. Some parents claim that it helps their baby sleep and reduces crying and anxiety, but there are concerns to consider. Swaddling is the practice of gently covering a baby in a light, airy blanket to induce calm and sleep. To prevent the risk of asphyxia, they should only have their bodies wrapped, not their heads or necks. Some people believe that swaddling helps their infant rest more readily and sleep longer, while others find it helps calm their infant. According to research, the combination of swaddling with sound and movement has been proven beneficial in managing crying infants. It can also promote deeper and longer sleep in infants. Another study discovered that swaddled premature infants were calmer, had better neuromuscular development and muscle tone, and experienced less pain and discomfort. It has been hypothesised that early swaddling could disrupt breastfeeding if skin-to-skin contact is prohibited during feeding. However, research has revealed no harmful effects on nursing over the long run. Some data suggests that swaddling a baby’s hips too tightly may increase the likelihood that they will develop hip dysplasia (a developmental disorder with the hip joint). Ensuring that your baby’s legs have sufficient space to flex up and out at the hips promotes the development of the hip joints. If you follow safe sleeping and hip-friendly swaddling guidelines, swaddling poses minimal risk to infants. Current baby sleeping advice is always to place your infant to sleep on their back and avoid front or side sleeping positions, especially if your infant is swaddled. In addition, you should stop swaddling your child as soon as they demonstrate the ability to roll over. Follow these safe swaddling guidelines: Introduce swaddling just when your infant is a newborn. As soon as they demonstrate signs of learning to roll over or are already able to roll over, stop swaddling them.
