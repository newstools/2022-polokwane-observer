If you think vitamin D deficiency is not of concern in sunny Africa, think again. As many as two in 10 Africans may be vitamin D deficient, suggesting that our continent may have the highest levels of severe vitamin D deficiency in the world.1 Enter the humble egg. Eggs are one of only a handful of foods that naturally contain this sunshine vitamin. One large egg (60 g) contains about 190 IU (international units) of vitamin D, almost one-third of our daily needs. And did you know that most of the vitamin D is in the egg yolk? Tossing the egg yolk may mean you miss out on zinc and selenium, two other nutrients important for supporting our immune system. Remember, too, that scientists think there may be a link between vitamin D deficiency and the risk of COVID-19 infections. In a new 2022 study,2 Israeli researchers found that those with a vitamin D deficiency were 14 times more likely to have the severe or critical disease than those with normal vitamin D levels. So why not serve up eggs whilst catching some rays at a picnic and get a double whammy of vitamin D?
