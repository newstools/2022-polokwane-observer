POLOKWANE – Local dentist Dr Tsholofelo Tsiane said people put themselves at risk of dental cavities and gum disease when they fail to maintain their oral hygiene. Tsiane, who is situated at the Polokwane Medical Centre at 51 Market Street spoke to the Polokwane Review about the importance of dental hygiene. “Dental hygiene is very important for all age groups. It entails taking care of your teeth and gums by keeping them clean and disease free. It also prevents problems such as tooth decay, gum disease, early loss of teeth via extraction and pain or sensitivity of the teeth,” she said.

Tsiane said gum disease also produces bad breath. “Normally the body’s natural defences and good oral health care, such as daily brushing and flossing, keep bacteria under control. However, without proper oral hygiene, bacteria can reach levels that might lead to oral infections,” she said. To truly maintain healthy gums and teeth and avoid other oral health problems, Tsiane said regular dental care visits are essential. “It is advisable to visit your dental surgeon every six months for a check-up and cleaning,” she advised.
