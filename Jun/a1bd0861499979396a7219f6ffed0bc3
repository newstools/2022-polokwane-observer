Two unlicensed firearms were found in the vehicle. A day after his arrest, the man was linked to another murder in Tubatse on April 1 as he was thought to have been involved in the shooting and killing of Lucas Malatji (35). “It is alleged that the suspect went to the house of the victim at Mabocha village, parked his vehicle at the gate and called the victim. When the victim alighted from the house, the suspect fired several shots killing the victim instantly. He then fled the scene,” Mojapelo said. The suspect is expected to appear in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court soon for Tayob’s murder. He will also appear in Tubatse Magistrate’s Court today for the murder of Malatji and will appear in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court on July 1 for the murder of Luvhimbi.
