POLOKWANE – Pietersburg English Medium Primary School (PEMPS) named its new conference room after Reverend Maphari John Rangongo. Rangongo is a former school governing body (SGB) chairperson, a position he held between 2016 to 2021. He expressed gratitude at the recognition for the impact that he had on the school and added that it was amazing to have the conference room named after him, seeing as there were several SGB chairpersons before him. “It is God who was in me that led to the work I did for the school and for them to take considerable action of naming the school conference room after me,” he said. Rangongo said that during his tenure as chairperson, his intention was to work with the school and not against it. “Most chairpersons have a tendency of opposing the school forgetting that they are there to support the school. I had to bridge the relationship between the school and the department by stating the issues that the school was facing,” he said. He added that he would constantly reassure the school that both the school and SGB are both employees of the Department of Education and they will work hand in hand. Those are some of the contributions he made that he feels he was recognised for. “I have learned a lot from the school, and my colleagues as SGB. These were the efforts of a collective,” he said.
