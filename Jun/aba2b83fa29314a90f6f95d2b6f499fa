Why use makeup brushes as opposed to your fingers, sponges or other applicators? Good quality makeup brushes make the process of applying makeup easier, they are the hygienic option (when washed regularly) and they help you achieve professional-looking results thanks to their blending and blurring abilities. But, with so many different makeup brushes on the market, choosing a select few can be quite overwhelming. Knowing exactly which ones to use with which products can be confusing. The truth is, that you don’t need every single brush available. You need a select few to cover the basics, such as foundation, blush and eyeshadow, and then a few others depending on the type of makeup you like to wear, such as an eyeliner brush, concealer brush or highlighter brush. Because it can be hard to narrow down, Sunpac (SA’s leading distributor of top international brands) shares the top ten makeup brushes every makeup lover should have in their arsenal.
