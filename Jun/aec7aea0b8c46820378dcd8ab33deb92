POLOKWANE – The day will see 110 cars from various motorsport clubs in the country outpace each other on the track. According to Kerry Smit from Unique Raceway and promoter of the event, only 2 500 spectators will be allowed at the track. “The event will be the first major oval race in the province since 2018 and one can imagine how excited the fans are. We have revamped the oval and it has been restored to its original look. We have hired security personnel and we cannot wait to host families and to welcome them back to the sporting code.” Smit added the tickets for the event will be sold at the gate at R100 per person while children under the age of five years can enter for free. “It is advisable to arrive early to purchase the tickets to avoid disappointment. Stunning high-performance machines will be on display, and vendors who will showcase their products. Food vendors will be on site, as well as a DJ for the afterparty on the infield. A post-race prize-giving ceremony will be held and the oval fest driver of the day will receive R2 500.” She said Gary Fleming and FC Nieuwoudt, all the way from Cape Town will deliver some epic commentary during the race. “Spectators must bring their own drinks as there will be no cash bar on site.
