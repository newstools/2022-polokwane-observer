POLOKWANE – Rotary Club of Polokwane’s members reached out to the Turfloop community and donated a consignment of mattresses, blankets and rice sachets to Mampotse Crèche. The mattresses were donated by Sizabantu Piping Systems and transported by Benzema Group, both from Polokwane. Each rice sachet could provide six nourishing meals and contained a mixture of rice, dried carrots, onions, tomato, celery, cabbage, bell peppers, soy and flavouring. The meals were donated by Blessman International. Rotarian Phuti Ragaphola addressed the crèche’s staff and said they have an important role to play.

Ragaphola added she noticed toddlers learn about morals and values at an early age. “It is evident that they know about greeting, sharing and being kind to others,” she remarked and shared that an unknown motivator once said the greatest oak tree was once a little nut that held ground. “I want to encourage other organisations to also reach out to our institutions of early learning,” Ragaphola said. Mampotse Crèche principal Alpheus Modiba thanked the Rotarians and gave them a token of appreciation. “We will put the donation to good use for our 29 toddlers and staff members as we do not receive any support from government. Learners come here on weekdays and during school holidays when their parents have to work, we can’t allow them to roam the streets,” Modiba explained.
