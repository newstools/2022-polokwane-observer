POLOKWANE – The power utility Eskom said there is a likelihood that the stage of load-shedding will be increased during evening peaks. Eskom has just announced that Stage 2 load-shedding will be implemented from 10:00 to midnight tonight, while Stage 2 will be implemented from 05:00 to midnight from Thursday to Sunday. This is due to a breakdown of four generation units this morning which Eskom said is contributing to capacity constraints. “Eskom cautions the public that as the shortage of generation capacity persists, the system will continue to be constrained with an elevated risk of load-shedding over the coming weeks.” You can find the load-shedding schedules for Polokwane here.
