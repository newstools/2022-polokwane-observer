POLOKWANE – The EFF Student Command (EFFSC) at the University of Limpopo says there has been improvement in terms of police visibility around off-campus residences, after they submitted a memorandum in this regard. The organisation recently led students in protest to the Mankweng Police Station, calling for heightened patrols around off-campus residences after students reported a surge in burglaries, with some students having been raped, assaulted and their belongings forcefully taken from them. A student activist within the EFFSC, Khutso Mamabolo told BONUS that some students were starting to fear walking to and from campus due to the possibility of victimisation. “This then affects their academic activities as they tend to miss classes.” Mamabolo said upon submission to the police, they were assured that there would be more patrolling. “We are satisfied that this has indeed been the case. It would be good if even more resources could be appropriated towards student safety, as it is unfair that we have to repeatedly remind the police to ensure that students staying off-campus are kept safe.” The spokesperson for the police in Limpopo, Lt Col Mamphaswa Seabi told BONUS they can confirm that since receiving the memorandum, they have sharpened police patrols in the area. “We would not want to disclose the finer details of their patrols, as this gives criminals ideas.” The Lekgotla la Motswikitswiki, which is a voluntary community policing structure in Mankweng, said one of the prime reasons there have burglaries and robberies is the sun setting a lot earlier than in the warmer seasons. The co-ordinator and spokesperson of the structure, Pitsi Sehlapelo said students need to help them and police by walking in groups, by not using cellphones when walking alone and that they should always lock their rooms whether its during the day or night.
