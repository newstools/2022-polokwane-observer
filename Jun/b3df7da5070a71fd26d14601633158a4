Mashamaite requested that his private doctor be allowed to examine him but the state opposed and said he was attended to on June 6 and given his medication. The defence said they have a private doctor that is willing to attend to the accused while in prison and alleged that Mashamaite was not attended to on June 6. The court heard the head of the Polokwane Correctional Services will be summoned to explain why Mashamaite was not attended to as instructed.
