POLOKWANE – Municipal spokesperson Thipa Selala has warned residents in the municipal area that they may experience water supply challenges. He said in a statement that Lepelle Northern Water (LNW) informed them about an issue at the Ebenezer plant. “They notified us about a leaking flange adaptor. The LNW team has estimated five to six hours for the completion of repairs,” Selala explained. He said residents in the municipal area have already been affected by another problem at the Olifantspoort plant. “Pump station three at the plant was stopped due to a power dip and this resulted in low supply to the municipality. The municipality will monitor all affected areas and provide temporary relief through water tankers,” Selala added and said water supply will be restored once LNW has resolved the problems. “Residents are urged to contact the Municipal Water and Sanitation helpline on 015 290 2376,” he concluded.
