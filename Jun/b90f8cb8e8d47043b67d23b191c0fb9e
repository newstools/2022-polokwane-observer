Serves 4 You’ll need: 2 medium onions, finely diced; 1 large potato, finely cubed; 2 medium cooked beetroots, chopped; 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped; 1 small chilli, finely diced; 1 celery stalk, finely diced; 1 large carrot, peeled and finely diced; olive oil; 100g butter; sea salt and black pepper; 1 litre of vegetable stock; crème Fraiche to serve How to: In a large pot or casserole over medium-high heat add the butter to the pan along with a drizzle of olive oil. Once melted, add the onion, garlic, celery and chilli, cooking for a few minutes until the onions have softened and the garlic has become fragrant. Add the potato and carrot to the pan, stirring everything together so that it is all coated in butter. Make a cartouche (paper lid) out of baking parchment and then pop the lid on. Turn the heat down to medium and leave the vegetables to soften for around 6-8 minutes. Take the lid and cartouche off and add the cooked beetroot along with the vegetable stock. Bring to the boil and then leave to simmer for around 15 minutes until everything is soft and fragrant. Pulse the soup in a food processor or using a stick blender until very smooth and pink. Check the seasoning and serve in deep bowls with a dollop of crème Fraiche and some crusty bread. *Recipe and image by B-well.
