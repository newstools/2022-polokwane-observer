POLOKWANE – The Polokwane Specialised Commercial Crimes Court sentenced 35-year-old Kgomotso Yvonne Mashala to eight years imprisonment for two counts of theft on Monday (June 30). Provincial Hawks spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke said Mashala worked at the Polokwane Police Station as a cashier and was responsible for receiving and depositing state money into the state’s bank account between January 19 and February 7, 2018. “When auditors conducted an audit at the station, they found an amount of R264 729 missing and unaccounted for. It was then established that the money was stolen on different dates. The matter was then referred to the Hawks’ serious corruption investigation unit for further probe,” his statement read. Maluleke said the National Prosecuting Authority issued a summons for Mashala to appear in court on August 31, 2018, post investigation, to which she was served. She was out on bail before her sentencing. “On count one, the accused was sentenced to five years imprisonment wholly suspended on the condition that she repays R183 727. On count two, she was sentenced to three years imprisonment or R5 000 fine also wholly suspended on condition that she repays an amount of R81 001. The total amount to be repaid is R264 729,” Maluleke said.
