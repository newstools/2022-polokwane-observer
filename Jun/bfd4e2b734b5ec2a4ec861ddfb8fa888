POLOKWANE – The police in Limpopo said they are ready for any likelihood of a shutdown of socio-economic activity and mobility in the province tomorrow (June 10). Rumours of a national shutdown have spread like wildfire over the past week with notices widely circulated on social media. These posts caution people not to go to work and for a stand-still of all economic activity.  The shutdown is reportedly meant to urge the government to cushion against the high cost of living in light of recent fuel price hikes. The Polokwane Review is in possession of a letter by a well-known security company that outlines possible risks and areas that could be affected by the shutdown. The highlighted areas are: Department of Mineral Resources on Dorp Street, the Department of Transport on corner Bodenstein and Church streets, all petrol stations as well as the R71 and N1 as possible protest points. Limpopo police spokesperson Lt Col Mamphaswa Seabi told Review that they have communicated with the leadership of both the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) and the National Taxi Alliance (NTA) in Limpopo who confirmed that there is no truth to the social media reports. “We are ready for any likelihood. It is our job to protect property, infrastructure and citizens,” he said. NTA Limpopo spokesperson Frans Kgasago said they have distanced themselves from the national shutdown, adding that NTA’s name was used without their knowledge. Santaco Limpopo chairperson Frans Ngoepe said there is no truth to online rumours and that their taxis will be operating tomorrow. Attempts to get comment from the the EFF went unanswered The National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure has also issued a statement saying those behind the rumours are warned and reminded that prohibiting people’s freedom of movement is a criminal offense. “Members of the public are therefore cautioned against spreading such messages,” the statement reads.
