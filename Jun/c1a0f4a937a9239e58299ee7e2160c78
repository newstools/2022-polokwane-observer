LIMPOPO – A cloud of sadness still hangs over Vari-Ha-Mutonga village after the 15-year-old Hlupheka Shishonge was stabbed to death by a 16-year-old boy on May 24. Hlupheka was a Gr 8 learner at Elim Secondary School. According to the provincial police spokesperson, Brig Motlafela Mojapelo, Hlupheka was on his way home from church at around 20:30 when an argument ensued between him and another boy. The boy then produced a knife, stabbed Hlupheka in the chest and ran off.

When we arrived at the scene, the young boy was lying dead on the ground. We subsequently opened a case of murder and arrested the 16-year-old suspect two days after the incident,” said Mojapelo. Hlupheka’s uncle, Thomas Baloyi, said that the family struggles to cope with their loss. “This is a big shock to us. Hlupheka was still so young. He was a bright learner who always worked hard at school. He was very focused on education and never quarreled with anyone. He easily associated himself with other people.” The suspect appeared briefly in the Waterval Magistrate’s Court on Monday, May 30. The case was postponed to June 13 for further police investigations. The murder of the young boy took place while the country observed the annual National Child Protection Week, which was from May 29 to June 6. The national campaign is led by the Department of Social Development in partnership with key government departments and civil society organisations to raise awareness of the rights of children as articulated in the South African Constitution and Children’s Act 38 of 2005. Protecting children from violence, exploitation and abuse is not only a basic value but also an obligation clearly set out in article 28 of the South African Constitution. Hlupheka was laid to rest at the Vari-Ha-Mutonga cemetery on Saturday, June 4.
