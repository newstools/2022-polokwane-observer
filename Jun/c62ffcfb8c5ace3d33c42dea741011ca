POLOKWANE – Two men and a woman were arrested in Mokopane yesterday (June 27). The trio, aged between 38 and 56, was nabbed after they kidnapped a 58-year-old woman in Polokwane. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo told Review that the woman was reportedly kidnapped along Dorp Street in Polokwane. “The trio impersonated police officers and kidnapped the woman. They then drove with her to a bank in Mokopane where they instructed her to withdraw all of her money. The officials at the bank suspected something was wrong and notified the police,” he explained. Mojapelo said that police officers dressed in civilian clothes entered the bank. “The woman did not withdraw her money and exited the bank. One of the suspects thought she withdrew the money and ushered her to a parked motor vehicle,” he added and said the officers shot at the tyres of the suspects’ vehicle. “The vehicle was immobilised and the three suspects were arrested. They appeared before the Mokopane Magistrate’s Court today (June 28) to face charges of attempted theft and impersonating a police officer. A case of kidnapping has been opened and will be transferred to Polokwane for further investigation,” Mojapelo explained. The suspects’ bail application was denied and they remain in custody. Mojapelo urged residents to be extra vigilant and not accept any advances by strangers to avoid similar situations.
