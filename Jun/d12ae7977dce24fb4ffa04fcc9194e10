Cheema then asked Ali to bring five refuse bags with him before he confessed to dismembering the deceased’s body. He put her body parts in refuse bags and disposed of them along the R37 road near Lydenburg,” Malabi Dzhangi said. Cheema pleaded not guilty to all offences and the court found him guilty as charged. In aggravation of sentence, the state advocate Nkhetheni Munyai said murder is a serious offence and the accused is not remorseful for his conduct. Munyai added that Magabane’s murder has had a huge impact on her family as they were unable to have a funeral for her because her body parts were not found. “The deceased had two children, who will never see their mother’s grave,” he said. During sentencing, Judge President Ephraim Makgoba said the court took into account the personal circumstances of the accused, the nature and seriousness of the offence and the interest of  society when imposing the sentence.
