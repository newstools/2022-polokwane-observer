POLOKWANE – Local animal activist and dog rescuer in her free time, Adéle Heinlein said it has been three weeks since Charlie, a Yorkshire Terrier, crawled through a gap in the fence of his owner’s yard in the Myngenoegen area. Adéle is now offering a R2 000 reward for anyone who sees the lost pup. “I got a call from someone about a little dog running wild in the area of the N1 Bloubul Padstal on the road to Louis Trichardt. I responded and tried to catch him, but he was very bewildered and got away every time.” Charlie was recently at a groomer for a hair cut and has a green flea collar on. Despite her many efforts to find the dog including an attempt to get drone footage, Adéle has also printed flyers in the hope of finding him. “His owners could not provide me with anything with his scent on to track him with other dogs, but we did try using Linda Dyer’s tracking dogs. The fact that he was seen so far from his house is also strange,” she said. Adéle has asked that people not approach the dog but to call her immediately on 061 524 1703.
