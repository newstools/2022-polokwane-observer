POLOKWANE – The Melisa Gilfillan Dance Academy (MGDA) hosted the Mzansi Ballet Company from Johannesburg at Bradbury Private Estate recently. In collaboration with the Mzansi Ballet Company, the Bradbury Private Estate and Sterling Productions, MGDA premiered their latest production called Abba, a Cinderella Story. MGDA owner Melisa Gilfillan told Polokwane Observer all three shows were sold out and the audiences were mesmerised by their outstanding technique and showmanship. The special guest artist and drag queen, Cathy Specific, who played the fairy godmother and Shana Dewey, who played the main character of the show, Cinderella, in the production and had audiences on their feet. The students of MGDA had the opportunity to share the stage with the Mzansi Ballet Company dancers. Ballet and contemporary workshops were also presented by the company to dancers from all over, including Tzaneen, Mokopane, Musina and Polokwane. “The events’ success exceeded our expectations. The aim of organising this event was to inspire the local ballet students, to let them see what professional ballet looks like and to let them be part of the dream. I decided to bring the big stage to Polokwane, not only to inspire the children, but the parents as well. It’s one thing to watch a ballet video on YouTube, it’s and entirely different thing to experience the excitement a few meters away from where you are sitting,” Gilfillan said. She concluded that not many people have the opportunity to travel to Gauteng to visit theatres, and that’s why she had invited the Mzansi Ballet Company to Polokwane instead. “This will become a yearly event for Polokwane to look forward to,” she added.
