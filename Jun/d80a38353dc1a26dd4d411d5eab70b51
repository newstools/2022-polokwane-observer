The national spokesperson of the ANC Pule Mabe said the start of Limpopo’s 10th elective conference has been delayed.  Speaking at a media briefing at the Ranch Resort where the conference is being hosted, Mabe explained that security for the event is of utmost importance, which is why there is a delay. “It is unforseen but we doubt it will affect the rest of the conference in any way. Delays are common,” he said. He added that other than the delay, they are hoping for a peaceful conference. The conference is hotly contested with current chairperson Chupu Mathabatha vying for a third term, while the current MEC for Public Works, Roads and Infrastructure Dr Dickson Masemola is contending for the same position.
