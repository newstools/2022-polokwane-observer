POLOKWANE – “My wish is for every child to read at home as well,” said Dorcas Maphalle, who decided to reach out and educate parents of Gr RR and Gr R children. Maphalle is a foundation phase teacher who wants to teach parents the alphabet in their own language. A few years ago she acquired some posters and placards with words and letters printed on it, which she donates to parents who need it.

I give parents a chart and tell them to put it in their room, where it is the first thing they see every morning. I also teach them how the letters sound and how to recognise them, in order for them to learn how to read.”  Maphalle believes you do not teach, nor do you learn in a set environment like a classroom alone, but everything you do can become a learning experience. “While you cook you can ask your child to bring two potatoes. They then have to be able to count to know how many potatoes to bring. While you play and jump around with your children you can teach them to count their repetitions. Not only will they learn, but both you and your child will get some healthy exercise. Shapes and colours can also be taught any time, any place. The shape of your key chain or the colour of the walls are examples of things you can point out to them.” Maphalle decided to donate her time, knowledge and resources because she feels it is time to take education seriously. She also founded a non-government organisation called Ithute Segageno. “This means to ‘learn your language’. I would like help with the registration of the organisation, and need sponsors to get more teaching aids. Anyone who can help is welcome to do so.”
