POLOKWANE – The area that stood vacant since Oasis Lodge was destroyed in a fire in 2012, is overgrown with grass and bushes and there are still some ruins left. It is the perfect area with a lot of hiding places that is now the home of Airsoft Polokwane. When you ask an airsoft player what the rules of the game are, they simply reply: Shoot each other. It is, however, not that simple as players are divided into teams and have to eliminate the other team by shooting at them with an airsoft gun. “Airsoft is a military simulation sport where we partake in mock combat with authentic military-style weapons and tactics,” says LJ Gerber, one of the founders of Airsoft Polokwane. The guns are full-scale replicas of real weapons used in combat and shoots 6mm ‘pellets’ made from hard plastic that are projected from the gun with air. All players and marshals have to wear safety gear such as safety glasses. “Since the pellets do not leave a mark like in paintball, the players have to be honest when they are shot. A medic, who can be any one of the player’s teammates, can then go and ‘heal’ the ‘injured’ player.” Apart from just shooting at each other, each team has some tasks to complete, people to capture and missions to complete. Games start early on a Saturday and can last until long after dark. Players under the age of 14 should be accommodated by their parents and there is a safety meeting before the game. Those who want to be part of the action but who are not interested in shooting, can watch from the ‘safe zones’. “To really get what this sport is about, you need to take part. There are guns and gear available for people who first want to see if they like the sport before they buy their own gear.” Interested residents can contact LJ on 071 475 5000 for more information.
