I hope to come back home with gold medals this time.” De Lange’s dream is to be part of the South African wrestling team that will participate at the 2024 Olympics scheduled for France from July 26, 2024 to August 11, 2024. “It has been my childhood dream to participate in the Olympics and I think I am ready for the challenge.” Ruan said he enjoyed wrestling with some of the top wrestlers from different countries at the event. “It was my first time travelling to an African country and I enjoyed every moment. The flight, the travelling, as well as the preparation for the fight was a whole new experience. The wrestling was different and the wrestlers are more technical and quick compared to the local wrestlers.” Coach Jan Roets said he is proud of his wrestlers’ achievements at the competition. “They did well, they just have to continue to work hard. These two are capable of winning every tournament, competing against any opponent.”
