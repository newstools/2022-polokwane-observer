POLOKWANE – The annual Om die Dam Ultra Marathon at Hartbeespoortdam High School on June 11 was once again a treat for runners. As the marathon was not held in 2020 and 2021, runners did not want to miss out on the opportunity to take part in this year’s event. Cronje, who ran her first Om die Dam, secured a third position in the ladies 50-59 category. She said she did not expect as many hills. “Pelandaba has 13 hills, all with an incline that surprises even the experienced runners. However, I had fun and I look forward to next year’s event.” Long-serving club member Potgieter ran her 11th Om die Dam and said it was good to run the old route again. “The organisers changed the route in 2018 and 2019 to accommodate the large field of runners, walkers and spectators. The route proved to be difficult and therefore regular runners of the race welcomed the decision to reinstate the old route. I enjoyed the race and hope to take part again next year.” She added that the marathon formed part of their club’s preparations for the Comrades Marathon. “The marathon helped us to prepare mentally for the upcoming Comrades. The Om die Dam marathon posed a lot of challenges for our athletes because we shared the road with trucks and the route had a lot of hills. Nevertheless, we need that challenge as we prepare for the Comrades.” She stated that their runners will participate in the Polokwane Mayoral Marathon on June 25 and the Foskor Marathon in Phalaborwa on July 30 before they head to Durban.
