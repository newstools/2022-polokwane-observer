POLOKWANE – The man who discovered the body of an infant in a dustbin at a shopping mall in Mankweng says he hasn’t been able to sleep since the day of the incident. Jan Setjie (27) from Ga-Thoka village says on the day, he had just started his routine of browsing the rubbish bins on June 14 when he came across a black plastic bag which he opened only to find tiny body parts and a lot of blood. Setjie, who collects leftover food from rubbish bins to sell to dog owners says: “I was frightened so I quickly threw the plastic bag into the bin and screamed for passers-by to assist. I was not even sure that what I saw was indeed human remains. When one lady came to check, she verified that it was and we alerted the police.”  Setjie says he hasn’t been able to sleep soundly after the gruesome discovery. “Since that day, my brother says I keep screaming in my sleep and when I wake up, I find myself teary-eyed. I need help.” Limpopo police spokesperson Lt Col Mamphaswa Seabi confirmed to BONUS that the Mankweng police opened a concealment of birth case after the remains of the newborn were discovered. Seabi says the allegations of the baby’s body having been found with stab wounds cannot be confirmed or denied and will be subjected to further investigations. Passers-by also expressed their shock at the incident. One resident who spoke to BONUS on condition of anonymity says: “It is disappointing that women don’t use condoms but will act like this when they conceive babies.” Another resident said: “This is nothing new. On our street, a girl gave birth at home and threw her baby into a pit toilet.” According to the police, no family has claimed knowledge of the abandoned baby and further information is yet to be established. Police say investigations continue, and they urged anyone with information to contact them forthwith.
