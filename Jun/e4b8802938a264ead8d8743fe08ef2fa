Mojapelo added that another unidentified body was also retrieved from the same mine shaft and investigations are underway to determine the identity and the cause of death. “We hope that the recovery of Malope’s remains will bring closure to the family as much as it strengthens our case against the accused,” the Provincial Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Hadebe said. The two suspects arrested will next appear before the Nebo Magistrate’s Court on Thursday (June 30) for formal bail application and face charges of kidnapping, murder and defeating the ends of justice.
