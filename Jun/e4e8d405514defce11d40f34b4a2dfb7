Whether you like them or not, party bags are becoming increasingly competitive. Here are some inexpensive party bag filler ideas that won’t break the bank and that your child’s friends will enjoy. Colouring books are excellent party favours. They can be purchased for a reasonable price at discount retailers. If you’re shopping for a large group, a colouring book and a small set of crayons will usually cost less than R20 per child – tie them together with a ribbon and label each set with the child’s name to hand out as they leave. Seedlings are the gift that keeps on giving. Pick up inexpensive tiny plant pots and seed packets at your local supermarket. Place the packets in the pots to present to your child’s guests. Bubbles are a traditional party bag filler, but bubble swords take it to the next level. Best of all, they can be given as a stand-alone gift without requiring a bag. When purchased in bulk, they are incredibly cost-efficient per head. Craft kits make a great take-home gift. Simply choose kits with the proper spectrum for your age group and shop around for the best price. Alternatively, make your own craft kits. Include some googly eyes, pipe cleaners, pom-poms, and yarn. A small bag of home-baked or store-bought cookies is a nice gift, but you can go upscale by including a cookie-cutter in the bag. Mine your local bargain store for cheap gifts. Wrap each gift in some paper and place them in a bucket with plenty of tissue paper and streamers. Let each youngster choose their own mystery gift.
