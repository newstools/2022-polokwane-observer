POLOKWANE – The Limpopo Impalas senior mens team has acquired the services of two cricket players from the Imperial Lions. Ruan Haasbroek and Louren Steenkamp have joined the union ahead of the Cricket South Africa (CSA) provincial T20 knock-out competition set to take place in July and August. Steenkamp, a batsman, made his first class debut for North West in the 2017-18 Sunfoil 3-Day Cup and his List A debut in the 2016–17 CSA Provincial One-Day Challenge. Haasbroek, a specialist bowler, also made his List A debut for North West in the 2016–17 CSA Provincial One-Day Challenge. He made his T20 debut at the 2017 Africa T20 Cup. Impalas head coach Dumisa Makalima told the Polokwane Observer that the two players bring a wealth of cricket experience to the team. “They have a lot of experience in franchise cricket and we believe they will help us in our efforts of achieving top honors in the upcoming season. Steenkamp is a top order batsman while Ruan is one of the top bowlers in the country,” he said. The duo’s inclusion in the team is said to bring a different dimension to their set-up following a poor performing season last year.

Some struggled to perform better and as coaches we could relate. The experience of the new players will rub off well on other players in the team.” Makalima said the Impalas want to do well this season and hope to play with aggression and zeal.
