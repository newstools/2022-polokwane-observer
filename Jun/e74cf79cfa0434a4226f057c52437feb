Tissue oil has really made a name for itself in recent years and has been clinically proven to moisturise dry and dehydrated skin, minimise the appearance of scars and stretch marks and enhance the functionality of the skin’s moisture barrier. In fact, it may even be better for your skin to replace your body lotion or cream with tissue oil as an everyday moisturiser. Bramley Cosmetics share reasons why tissue oil is better for your skin than body lotion: Shop Bramley Tissue Oil at Pep Stores nationwide. Learn more at https://bramleycosmetics.com/.
