Teens spend a lot of time in front of devices. But too much screen time might interfere with getting proper exercise, doing homework, being with friends, and spending time with family. There is a sense of impending dread in the air… The winter school break is approaching! And, if the weather during the past few weeks is any indication, the kids will be confined to their televisions for the next month. “By the time children enter adolescence, parents may feel less in control of their children’s screen time. Add to it a pandemic that compelled children to learn and socialise via screen, and it can be rather daunting,” says Jaco Joubert, brand manager for television brand SKYWORTH. Teens are more independent, yet it remains the responsibility of parents to determine when and how often they use screens. Teenagers may need to spend more time online to research school projects, but they may also spend a significant amount of time on social media, playing games, and watching television and YouTube videos.
