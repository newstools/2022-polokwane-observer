The newcomer also gets a boost in performance with the adoption of a larger 1.5-litre engine (as employed in the Urban Cruiser), replacing the outgoing 1.4-litre mill. This enhances performance by 9kW (for a total power output of 77kW), while the torque receives an 8Nm amplification to take it to a max of 138Nm. Despite the increase in performance, the fuel index remains low, ranging between 5.4 and 5.7 l/100km. In response to customer feedback and market trends, the new Starlet also boasts an upgraded specification roster. All models now come equipped with a touchscreen audio system (either 18 or 23cm) with USB, Bluetooth and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto interface, as well as a rear USB charger. Automatic climate control, power-retractable mirrors and electric windows are features on the standard menu.  Driver assistance is aided by rear parking sensors, hill assist control, vehicle stability control, ABS and EBD across the board. Driver and passenger airbags are also provided with the flagship Xr grade featuring side and curtain versions too. The top-tier Xr model adds smart entry, push start and cruise control among other niceties.  Pricing Pricing starts at R226 200 and includes a three-services/45 000km service plan – with 15 000km service intervals. A three-year/100 000km warranty is also provided. Customers can additionally purchase the service plan and warranty extensions from their local Toyota dealer – and they benefit from the biggest dealer network in the country (over 220 outlets).
