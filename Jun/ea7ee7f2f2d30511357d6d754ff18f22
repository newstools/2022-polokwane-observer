POLOKWANE – Eskom COO Jan Oberholzer said there is a very real risk of Stage 6 load-shedding during peak hours tonight. Oberholzer said there has been a significant deterioration overnight and that there is a deficit of 4000 MW for the evening peak, which includes Stage 4 load-shedding. As of now, Stage 4 load-shedding will remain in place every day from 05:00-00:00, however, if Eskom can’t return units to the grid, Stage 6 will be implemented from 17:00. “Eskom hasn’t taken the decision lightly and that the last time there was Stage 6 load-shedding was in December 2019,” Oberholzer said This is what Stage 6 load-shedding will look like for Polokwane:  PDF download: Load Shedding Stage 5 and 6 (1_6_2022)
