POLOKWANE – With the school holiday merely days away both learners and teachers will get some time off to relax at home or travel with their families. While at home, children are less likely to excercise and Bet-Shalom Christian School’s sports coordinator Reamone Saville has encouraged learners to remain active. Saville said whether it is playing a sport, going to a gym or even running around, physical activity remains a critical part of a child’s development and growth. “It is important to make sure that your child spends less time on the couch or their phones and rather get the recommended amount of physical activity instead,” Reamone said.

An hour a day is sufficient to improve coordination and muscle strength,” he added. Reamone also suggests indoor exercises such as jumping jacks, stretching, sit-ups or frog jumps if it’s too cold to exercise outside. ”If the weather plays along, then children can play games such as tag-you’re it, hide-and-seek or playing with your pets. “There are many activities kids can do at home that can be fun and keep them fit You just have to think outside the box,” he concluded.
