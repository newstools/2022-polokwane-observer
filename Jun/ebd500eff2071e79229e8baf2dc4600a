POLOKWANE – The Polokwane Municipality said the burst water pipe on the corner of Potgieter Avenue and Diemeer Street is being attended to. The leak, which was said to have been reported on Sunday, has seen streams of water run down Potgieter Avenue over the past two days and the area has been cordoned off as a result. A video, taken by DA Councillors Johan Retters and Jacques Joubert on Monday night (June 13), shows water bubbling out of a hole on to the street. Municipal spokesperson Thipa Selala said Annadale and parts of Ladanna have been affected by the burst pipe and Sterpark is experiencing low pressure as a result. “The municipal water team is already working on restoring water supply within an estimated four to six hours from now,” he said. Meanwhile, water in other parts of the city will be affected by a stoppage from the Olifantspoort Scheme line. Lepelle Northern Water (LNW) said the stoppage is due to two pipe bursts on their main line and will affect all areas of supply. “LNW has estimated eight hours until repairs are completed. Water supply to all affected areas within Polokwane Municipality shall be restored once LNW has completed repairs,” Selala said.
