“The new Gladiator is the ultimate vehicle for any outdoor adventure,” said Leslie Ramsoomar, managing director of Stellantis South Africa. It delivers legendary capability with composed on-road driving dynamics and passenger safety courtesy of the Command-Trac and Rock-Trac 4×4 systems, third-generation Dana 44 axles, Tru-Lock electric front- and rear-axle lockers, Trac-Lok limited-slip differential, segment-exclusive sway-bar disconnect and off-road tyres. A modern take on authentic Jeep design The Jeep design team kept the legendary seven-slot grille seen on the Wrangler, but widened the grille slots for additional air intake to assist with the increased towing capacity. The top of the keystone-shaped grille is gently swept back to enhance aerodynamics.
Gladiator Rubicon features LED headlamps and fog lamps that project crisp white lighting, adding to the truck’s modern look. Daytime running lights, which form a halo around the outside perimeter of the headlights, also highlight the traditional Jeep face, with indicators positioned on the front of the trapezoidal wheel flares. From behind, traditional square tail lamps feature LED lighting and give way to a wide tailgate opening for unobstructed loading of cargo into the bed. The tailgate is damped and capable of stopping in three positions, while cargo is easily secured with a power-locking tailgate.
Clever functionality and versatility were the focus while designing the Gladiator’s durable bed to streamline usability. Under-rail bed lighting and strong integrated tie-downs provide durability and versatility. The Trail Rail Cargo Management System provides additional storage options to organise and secure cargo.  The full-size spare tyre and mount is located under the bed, behind the rear axle and capable of holding up to a 35-inch tyre. The Gladiator’s load bed is lined with a special scratch-resistant layer and a roll-up rigid loading cover. A four-bolt design at the top of the windshield’s frame allows for the windscreen to fold down quickly and easily. A header bar connects the A-pillars and stays in place even when the windscreen is folded down. This allows the rearview mirror to remain in place even with the windscreen folded. Lightweight, high-strength aluminium doors feature the Torx bit size stamped directly onto the hinge to eliminate guessing which size bit is needed to remove the doors. A tool kit with the necessary Torx bits to remove the doors and lower the windscreen is provided as standard equipment. The new Jeep Gladiator’s interior combines authentic styling, versatility, comfort and intuitive feature use. Precision craftsmanship and high-quality materials are found throughout the cabin.  Jeep functionality and versatility are celebrated in the centre console and distinguished with metal-plated accents. The centre console houses gear shift selection, transfer case and parking brake. Real bolts featured on the shifter, grab handles and the infotainment screen’s frame highlight genuine construction methods. All-new rear seats feature high-quality premium materials, giving the seats an athletic look that also delivers comfort and support. The rear seats, exclusive to Gladiator, feature segment-leading rear legroom and use a unique design that can be locked in place to provide secure storage behind the seat back. The rear seats can be folded flat to access cab-back storage and provide a load floor for larger items. With the rear seats folded flat, LED lights on the quarter trim panels to illuminate the storage space behind the seats. Two storage nets on the cab-back wall provide even more secure storage. Clever storage solutions are found throughout the Gladiator, including durable mesh pockets that extend the entire length of the doors and numerous phone storage areas. The driver and front passenger vinyl-wrapped door-trim panels are soft to the touch. Lift-Assist handles under each door armrest feature an integrated pull-cup design that makes door removal quick and easy. Convenience features include passive entry with Keyless Go. The instrument cluster an available seven-inch thin-film transistor (TFT) information LED display. The display allows the driver to configure information in more than 100 ways, including current media being played, tyre pressure, tyre fill alert or digital speed readout. Integrated buttons on the steering wheel control audio, voice and speed functions, allowing the driver to keep their hands on the wheel at all times.  An 8.4-inch touchscreen houses the fourth-generation Uconnect system and sits prominently atop the centre stack. The fourth-generation Uconnect system enhances the user interface and system performance with quicker startup times and improved screen resolution. Directly below the touchscreen are functional features, such as climate and volume control knobs and media connectivity ports. Two USB ports and a USB-C port up front and two in reach of occupants in the back seat connect to the media centre. Optional audio upgrades include a subwoofer and a portable wireless speaker located behind the rear seat. LED lights on quarter-trim panels illuminate the storage space and the docking station for the wireless speaker. A net on the left side of the cab wall provides additional storage when equipped with the subwoofer and wireless speaker. Advanced fuel-efficient powertrains The all-new Jeep Gladiator offers the proven 3.6-litre Pentastar V6 engine delivering 209kW and 347Nm of torque and features ESS as standard equipment. It is engineered to provide a broad torque band with a focus on low-end torque, an essential trait needed for extreme off-roading. The Jeep Gladiator offers an eight-speed automatic transmission, enabling the vehicle to optimise engine output while on the trails or enjoying smooth, efficient power delivery at highway speeds. A unique set of two overdrive ratios improve open road fuel economy and reduce overall noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) levels.
Uniquely suited to the requirements of the Gladiator Rubicon model, the eight-speed automatic transmission delivers a 77.2:1 crawl ratio.  The towing and 4×4 performance benefits from a 4.7:1 first gear ratio coupled with a 4.1:1 final drive.
Selec-Speed Control is standard with the eight-speed automatic transmission and manages vehicle speed in “4LO” while traversing off-road terrain without requiring throttle or brake input, allowing the driver to focus on steering. Selec-Speed Control is activated using a button on the dashboard and can be adjusted from 1-8km/h simply by using the AutoStick shift control. Most capable Jeep pickup ever without compromise The all-new Jeep Gladiator delivers legendary off-road capability. The Rock-Trac 4×4 system features heavy-duty third-generation Dana 44 front and rear axles with a “4LO” ratio of 4:1. A 4.10 front and rear axle ratio is standard as are Tru-Lok locking differentials. Gladiator Rubicon models offer improved articulation and total suspension travel with help from a segment-exclusive electronic sway-bar disconnect. With the standard eight-speed automatic transmission, the Rubicon has an impressive crawl ratio of 77.2:1, making scaling any obstacle on the trail easy. Rock-Trac also offers full-time torque management, enabling optimal grip in low-traction conditions. An approach angle of 43.6 degrees, breakover angle of 20.3 degrees, departure angle of 26 degrees and a ground clearance of 249mm allows Gladiator to go anywhere. With more than 80 available advanced safety and security features included, the Uconnect system includes easy-to-use features, enhanced processing power, faster startup times and touchscreens that display high-resolution graphics, Apple CarPlay and iPhone compatibility. The Gladiator is the latest iteration in a long line of Jeep brand trucks that began back in 1947 when Willys Overland introduced a one-tonne truck with four-wheel drive based on the CJ-2A.  With more than 40 years of rich heritage to draw from, Gladiator is the latest in a long line of Jeep trucks that includes: • Jeep Pickup: 1947-1965
A 118-inch wheelbase pickup that realised few product changes. It was Willys-Overland’s first attempt to diversify the Jeep brand from the CJ.
• Jeep FC-150/170 Pickup: 1957-1965
These Forward-Control series Jeep vehicles were essentially working trucks – with an 81-inch wheelbase for the FC-150 and 103.5 inches for the FC-170. They received few changes during their life cycle, though some 1959 and 1960 models featured full-floating front and rear axles, and some FC-170 models included dual rear wheels and a four-speed manual transmission.
• Jeep Gladiator/J-Series Pickup: 1963-1987
Resembling the Wagoneer, Gladiator debuted in 1963 in either 120-inch (J-200) or 126-inch (J-300) form and featured a Dana 20 transfer case and Dana 44s front and rear. The Gladiator name was dropped in 1972.  • Jeep CJ-8 Scrambler: 1981-1985
Introduced in 1981, the Scrambler was a Jeep similar to the CJ-7, but with a longer wheelbase. Known internationally as the CJ-8, it was available in either hard- or soft-top versions. Less than 30 000 Scramblers were built and are extremely popular among collectors today.
• Jeep Comanche (MJ): 1986-1992
Based on the Cherokee platform and similarly equipped, the pickup received a six-foot bed in 1987. Later models offered Selec-Trac or Command-Trac four-wheel drive. • Retail price: R1 259 900
• Maintenance plan: three years/100 000km
• Warranty plan: five years/100 000km
