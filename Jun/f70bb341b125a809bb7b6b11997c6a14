I made a lot of mistakes during my final match and will learn from it. I am glad I competed in this event because it is through such events where we learn to handle pressure. The experience I gained at the event was valuable. It was a tough competition, an eye opener and I realised the older you get the tougher the competition becomes.” The 2019 bronze medallist at the Continental Wrestling Championship held in Tunisia said she aspires to be part of the South African 2024 Olympics team. “I want to compete internationally and against the best wrestlers in the world. I will continue to work hard and limit the mistakes I make in my matches. The Olympic dream is possible and I will continue to work towards it.” Another wrestler who competed in Morocco, Marais Hattingh, said despite being knocked out in the first stage of the championship, he still wants to compete in other international championships. “I was not happy with my performance and I wish I had more matches at the championship as I only competed in one match. I want to compete in other international competitions, so I will continue to improve my wrestling.”
