Decorex Africa takes place in Cape Town and Johannesburg during the months of June and July. The “Garage of the Future” is progressive, electrified and functional and will showcase Donald’s ideas for shaping the design of the present and the future. The exhibition stand will also showcase the recently launched Audi RS e-tron GT – an electric vehicle that reinterprets the classic idea of the gran turismo: its design is highly emotive and its technology is revolutionary. The Audi RS e-tron GT will be supported by the sporty electric SUV, the Audi e-tron S Sportback.  Tarryn Knight, the head of marketing, product and PR for Audi South Africa said, “At Audi, we believe that the future is an attitude – and that we have to embrace a mindset that is geared to take the leaps needed to change today for a progressive tomorrow. Decorex Africa and Donald’s interpretation of the “Garage of the Future” is a fitting collaboration to show the diverse way that design impacts each and every area of our lives.” “Imagine you are headed home in your fully electric vehicle, it is quiet and as you enter your garage, you are welcomed by modern design that meets traditional craftsmanship – a cladded tunnel, seamless flooring materials and simplicity to park and plug your e-tron on charge. I believe that the garage design ideas of the future will not only include a haven for your vehicle. It will become a vehicle showcase and experience space suited to your specific lifestyle, replete with designer seating to relax and recharge – in this case a lounging area,” Nxumalo said.  The concept behind the garage of the future aims to showcase the progressive nature that characteristics like design, digitalisation and sustainability can play in the effort to truly progress Audi’s e-mobility strategy forward. Decorex Africa 2022 will be in Johannesburg from July 28 to 31, when visitors will be able to experience the garage of the future for themselves. Source: MotorPress
