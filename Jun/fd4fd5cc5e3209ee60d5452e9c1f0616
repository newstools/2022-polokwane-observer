Dining rooms are making a comeback thanks to Covid-19 lockdowns. However, casual dining is in, whereas formal dining is out, according to EZLiving (https://www.ezlivingfurniture.ie/). Formal dining rooms are being replaced with multi-functional entertainment areas. Furniture items include dining benches that make space for additional diners, comfy bar stools at kitchen counters for relaxed conversations, and endless cups of tea and coffee. Open plan living areas are even more popular than before, and dining tables have taken on new shapes with an increased focus on functionality. Round and oval dining tables – in fact, any table with rounded edges – are on trend this year. These shapes are more approachable, comfortable and ideal for a more casual dining experience. Lighter colours tend to be more welcoming and create a relaxed atmosphere. Favourite shades are sandier, mid-tone colours or those with a grey undertone like oak, beech, and ash. Dark woods like mahogany, walnut and rosewood work well with a more formal look, so they are taking a back seat this year. Because conversation and shared meals are the focal point in the dining area, your dining table should be adaptable to any activity. Ideally, it needs to be able to extend to accommodate a dinner party and large homework projects. Dining chairs upholstered or painted in earthy rust-orange or amber yellow form a striking contrast to light-coloured wood tables. Other popular shades are navy blue and emerald green. Retro, heavy textiles such as corduroy and velvet are replacing lighter fabrics and linens, and smooth genuine leather and faux leather create a modern industrial look. According to www.hackrea.com, natural materials are on trend in dining rooms in 2022. Above all, dining areas of 2022 should reflect the functional use of space combined with superb design.
