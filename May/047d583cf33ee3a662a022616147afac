POLOKWANE – As the cut-off low system continues moving over South Africa, the South African Weather Service (SAWS) has issued a Level 2 warning for severe thunderstorms in Polokwane and other parts of Limpopo.  The SAWS said cold air combined with an unstable atmosphere due to the cut-off low may result in isolated severe thunderstorms over the central and eastern parts of Limpopo. “Models are currently suggesting 15-25mm from these storms with heavier rainfall of 40-70mm possible in the eastern parts,” a warning read. Strong winds, localised flooding, heavy downpours, difficult driving conditions and localised damage to structures due to large amounts of small hail have all been added to the warning.  The SAWS said the warning is valid from 10:00 to midnight.
