POLOKWANE – Baroka Football Club head coach Phaladi Kobola said the club will return to the Premier Soccer League (PSL) in 2024. Baroka were relegated from the top flight on May 21 after a 1-0 loss to Maritzburg United at the Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg. Kobola said a lack of organisation and consistency in most of their matches cost them their PSL status. “We conceded a lot of goals this season and we lacked experience in some of the playing departments. We will, however, learn from our mistakes and I think we will be a strong team in the Glad Africa Championship next season.” He added that the relegation will have an adverse effect on the players and soccer loving community, as well as the people of the province. “Baroka is a community football club and people relied a lot on the club. The club fed a lot of families, the players and the hawkers who sell various goods and products at our home matches. A lot of people relied heavily on the club for an income.” The Seshego-born mentor said restructuring will be key in their efforts to return to the PSL for the 2023/24 season. “We learned valuable lessons this season. We made mistakes which we take full responsibility for. We have to keep half of the team, add a few experienced players and we will have a solid team that will compete in the championship. The aim is to return to the league as soon as possible. “ Baroka’s departure from the PSL leaves the province with only Marumo Gallants Football Club in the league. Bakgakga, as they are effectively known in the football circles, spent six seasons in the league after they were promoted in 2016. Their stay in the top flight saw them beat the mighty Orlando Pirates in 2018 to win the Telkom Knockout Cup.
