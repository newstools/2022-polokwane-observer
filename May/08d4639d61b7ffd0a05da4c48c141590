POLOKWANE – It was a night to remember as Seshego’s very own locally inspired comedy event, the Seshego Comedy Fiesta, was launched on May 18 in Zone 4. Thau Thau Haramanuba welcomed all the guests, after which the audience was entertained with jokes from TikTok comedian Muruti Mojomane and Mokopane’s very own Magezi. They were also given advice from the author of Africa is open for business, Victor Kgomoeswana and the CEO of Pushatainment, Leonard Legodi, who enjoyed some time on stage. The comedy fiesta launch, founded by Pushatainment, was supported by multiple businesses including Woodworx, Matuba, Ramatlaohle, Rep Digital, Pelebese Projects, Sunset View, Lahom, KM Mothupi and Bitcoin, who all had representatives attend the evening in support of the event to ensure its success. Legodi explained the event’s objective in detail: “The comedy fiesta was inspired by my love for performing arts. We want to give the people of Seshego their own inspiration and platform for up-and-coming comedians who are still growing in the industry.”  Legodi said the plan is to host the comedy fiesta annually to support various local comedians. The Seshego comedy fiesta promises to bring with it lots of fun and good company. The main event is set to be hosted on July 2 at Ngoako Ramahlodi Sports Complex under the theme ‘red carpet things’.
