Feeling a little out of sorts? Need an energy boost or some internal motivation to get you going? Perhaps you should try wearing your birthstone. Some might say it’s hocus pocus, but there is a strong belief in the healing properties of gemstones. Black Betty jewelry designer, Kristin Weixelbaumer, worked closely with Cape Town astrologer Nicole L Smith to create her Zodiac range and shares five reasons to consider wearing your birthstone: Let them heal you The stones may help to ‘release’ blockages in your spiritual, mental, and physical well-being as they are said to have the power to focus healing energies of the planet onto your body, through contact with the skin. They can also help you to feel more relaxed and stimulated. Restore your ‘cosmic colour’ Birthstones help to align your zodiac sign with you. When your being is aligned to nature, ‘cosmic colours’ are able to come into alignment. The cosmic colour assists in making you feel stronger, both physically and mentally. Bring you luck and prosperity By strengthening your energy and removing obstacles from your path, birthstones can help guide you to the positive aspect in life.
