POLOKWANE – Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe has warned residents to be extra careful when they seek employment. Hadebe’s warning follows an incident where three job seekers were lured to Tzaneen for non-existing employment. According to a statement by police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, the trio were kidnapped, robbed and extorted. “The three victims, a 27-year-old man and two women (aged 21 and 33) boarded taxis from Jane Furse, Groblersdal and Thohoyandou respectively in search of employment. They responded to a Facebook advert and were instructed via WhatsApp to meet at a filling station in town,” he explained. Four men awaited the job seekers at the filling station. “The suspects and the victims took a taxi towards Bolobedu, but they were dropped off near a secluded bushy area. Here they were reportedly robbed of their cellphones, money and clothes after they were ordered to strip naked. The suspects took photos of the nude victims and sent it to family members of one of the victims, to demand money for their release,” Mojapelo added. He said the suspects reportedly ordered the man to rape one of the women. “A motorist found them hitchhiking along the road and took them to the Tzaneen Police Station on Sunday (May 29). The police opened cases of kidnapping, rape and robbery. Residents are requested to provide the police with any information that can lead to the arrest of the suspects,” Mojapelo urged. Those with information can contact Lieutenant Colonel Tshinyadzo Ndou on 082 807 2666, the Crime Stop number on 08600 10111 or their nearest police station.
