Makes 6-8 desserts You’ll need: 135g flour; 1 large egg; 2g salt; 30g almond flour; 90g icing sugar; 100g butter, cold; ½ vanilla pod. For the filling: 250g Mascarpone cheese; 180g Nestlé Full Cream Sweetened Condensed Milk; 125g Ricotta cheese, softened. For the garnish: Fresh raspberries; Pistachios, chopped; Nestlé Milkybar Dessert Topping, for drizzling. How to: In a bowl of an electric mixer beat together the mascarpone cheese and ricotta cheese until well aerated. Beat in the Nestlé Full Cream Sweetened Condensed Milk, cover and place in the fridge until needed. For the tart case; combine the flour and almond flour. Place onto a clean counter and make a well. Add the icing sugar, salt, butter, egg and vanilla. Using your fingertips mix everything until a dough forms. Cover in cling wrap and place in the fridge to rest. Approximately 1 hour. Once the pastry is rested roll out to approximately 1cm thick and place in a well-greased 24cm tart tin. Place a piece of baking paper on top and fill with dry beans/rice. Blind bake in a preheated oven at 180°C for 15 minutes. Remove the baking paper and beans/rice and continue to bake for 5 minutes. Allow the tart case to cool before pouring in the filling. Garnish with raspberries, pistachios and drizzled Nestlé Milkybar Dessert Topping before serving. Note: Use Nestlé Milkybar Dessert Topping and Nestlé Full Cream Sweetened Condensed Milk as your sugar addition in tarts and pies; they will also help set the filling.
