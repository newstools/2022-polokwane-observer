POLOKWANE – 13-year-old Ratile Lerutle said it would mean a lot to play in provincial tournaments in Stellenbosch and Boksburg in June. The primary school learner was recently picked for both the Limpopo Hockey A and Limpopo Netball teams but needs to raise R6 500 and R5 950 respectively in order to compete. Her mother, Evelyn, said they are still new to Polokwane and haven’t made enough friends to pull together to raise the money for Ratile. “We don’t know many people and the people who have donated so far are the few friends that we have made since moving here but we still need help to make her dream of competing a reality,” she said. She added that even if she can be assisted with half the amount and she will try to get the outstanding amount. “It is big opportunity for me to compete and I promise to play my best and make the people who help get me there proud,” Ratile said. Her mother shared that she saw Ratile’s talent from an early age and that she has always been a good athlete. “She broke a 20-year record for cross country in 2017 and when we moved to Polokwane, she was exposed to other sports other than athletics,” she said. Evelyn added that Ratile plays hockey, netball and cricket and because she is still young, her mother felt it was too soon to make her choose as it would be unfair. “I have seen my child play and I support her dream. At this moment, I am unable to fully support that dream which is why I am asking people to help me support my rising star to become what God has created her to be,” she said. Evelyn can be reached at 073 581 2288. Payment can be made directly into the teams’ FNB accounts. Hockey 62287446093 ref Ratile Lerutla Netball  62807927192 ref Ratile Lerutla
