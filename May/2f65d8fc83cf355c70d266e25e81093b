POLOKWANE – For children who will be attending school for the first time, registration will be open from May 24 to July 29 as well as for those children who will enrol at a new school. All public schools have been identified as designated areas for collection and submission of admission forms – this means parents or guardians can collect registration forms from the school that is situated closest to their place of residence, or that falls within their feeder zone. Admissions will be processed on a first-come-first-served basis where all criteria in the admission guidelines are met. School management teams have been directed to ensure that the process of collection and return of forms is managed in line with the department’s standard operating procedures for the management of Covid-19 in schools, which means strict adherence to screening, sanitising and social distancing protocols throughout the process.
