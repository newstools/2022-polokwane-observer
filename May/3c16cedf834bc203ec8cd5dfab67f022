POLOKWANE – Stage 2 load-shedding will continue from 17:00 to 19:00 for the rest of the week. Eskom said this is due to the continued shortage of generation capacity. The power utility said while there may be instances where load-shedding might need to be implemented outside of these hours, Eskom will try to push load-shedding to the evening slots to limit its impact. #PowerAlert2 Due to the continued shortage of generation capacity, Stage 2 loadshedding will be implemented from 17:00 until 22:00 throughout the week. pic.twitter.com/E40GBxaAjs — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) May 22, 2022  You can find Polokwane’s load-shedding schedule here.
