UK customers will receive their new cars from June through Moke’s official UK distributor, Hendy Group. Perfect partners For guests at Beaverbrook, the quintessentially English country house estate, the Moke electric’s whisper-quiet, sustainable drivetrain makes it the ideal companion for savouring the peaceful countryside and secluded lanes of the Surrey Hills, an area of outstanding natural beauty in the south of England. The battery has a sufficient range (120km) travelling at a leisurely pace of about 80km/h.  Summer is when the electric Moke truly comes into its own as the ultimate countryside and beach cruiser. The fully electric powertrain offers enhanced performance and effortless driveability, free of noise pollution. With a typical range of around 120km, the Moke is eminently suitable for days at the beach, country picnics and other summer activities: a rapid charge time of just four hours (from a mains charger) ensures it is always ready for the next adventure.  The electric Moke’s fun-loving, outdoor character is reflected in the colour palette – wave blue, sunlight yellow, sunset orange, scuba blue and granite grey – offered on the standard model; customers will also be able to personalise their car to their exact tastes and sensibilities later this year.
