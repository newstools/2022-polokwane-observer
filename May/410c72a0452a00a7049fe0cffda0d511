MOKOPANE – Ensuring that orphans in and around town are warm this winter is what the Blankets of Love campaign is all about. “We noticed that some children and the homeless are sleeping under plastic bags,” said the founder of the World Changers Movement, Puleng Mokonyane. He explained that the non-profit organisation not only gathered school uniforms for children who lost their parents, but they also noticed a need for blankets.

The centre provides a safe home for the orphans around the area but are dependant on donations. “We aim to provide them with a sense of belonging which is very important for their social development,” he said adding that the movement is a NPO that has been operating since 2015, and is managed by a group of highly motivated young people who are impact-driven. “Our objective is to minimise the traumatic experience that orphans go through without parents. At the moment we care for more than 100 children. We also empower young people with relevant information to become responsible men and women, and host entrepreneurship seminars where we invite businesses and the municipality to present the young entrepreneurs with opportunities around town.” Mokonyane explained that the children are also in need of school shoes. “We saw that the children desperately need school shoes.” He added that with the cold winter months ahead, most of the children walk barefoot to school and therefore the organisation started gathering donations to buy shoes. Mokonyane urged residents to open their hearts an assist with donations. For more information contact Mokonyane on 083 506 8753.
