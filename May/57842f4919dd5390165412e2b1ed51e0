The average person (if lucky enough to have a job) will spend about 30% of their life, or on average about 90 000 hours at work.  Spending those hours at a place you don’t like, or doing what you don’t like, can be a very gloomy prospect.  All the more reason for you to try and find what you really want to do, and to try and upskill yourself into a position where you can start making that dream come true. Prospective employees can do a lot to upskill themselves and try to gain experience to get that dream job that makes them tick.  The question now should also be, what is the workplace doing to attract and retain that top talent?  It actually boils down to a few very simple and easy points: Wellbeing in the workplace is looking after the physical but also the mental wellbeing of employees, and this must include areas to unwind.  Getting a balance between work and play is becoming more and more important.  Balance in life is something that is much needed, mindfulness must become the norm so that we can identify possible problems for ourselves before burnout hits.  It is time to take on a more proactive way of looking after ourselves, our employees, our families and our friends.
