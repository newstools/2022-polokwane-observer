According to a study published in Pediatrics, sitting in the middle rear seat is 43% safer than sitting on the side in the back for children ages newborn to three years old. The rear centre position will be the furthest away from any collision in any type of crash. The researchers discovered that the vehicle’s rear passenger side was the most common placement for a car seat (41% of parents installed the child’s car seat here). We’re not sure why so many parents place your car seat there. This could be for convenience or to keep an eye on the baby. Installing a rear-facing seat in front of a deployed airbag is never a smart idea. Unless absolutely necessary, such as in a two-seater vehicle, keep children in car seats in the back seat. The centre is the safest, assuming that all sitting places are appropriately installed. The centre seating position is no longer the safest position if it cannot be positioned properly and safely. In this case, there are two schools of thought: Place the baby in the centre rear seat because it is the most vulnerable in a crash. Place a forward-facing older child in the middle seat, presuming the older child is forward-facing because rear-facing children are inherently safer in their rear-facing seat. We believe in the first school of thought, which maintains that the most vulnerable child, i.e. the youngest child, should be placed at the centre. The following crash dynamics influence this decision: Even in the event of an accident, the middle centre seat would be the farthest away from the impact. The third-row seat in some vehicles is situated above the back axle, which may provide some impact protection in a side-impact crash. Otherwise, the rules remain unchanged. Most importantly, guarantee correct installation. Consider how easy you can get back there to belt up children seated in the third row. Older, more autonomous children can sit in the back row, while younger children can sit in the centre row.
