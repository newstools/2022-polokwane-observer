The fourth round of the KwaZulu-Natal Rotax Max Challenge delivered plenty of sparkle and spice on Sunday, May 22. The recent rain made itself felt on the day, but could not keep the karters away. Jonathan Pieterse took an overall DD2 triple. Brent Walden hit trouble in heat 1, but fought back with a couple of seconds to take third over Shane Foley on a count-back after they had tied on points for the day. Opening heat second man Nicholas Wuite beat Riley Horner, Alistair Mingay and Reval Gayadin to fourth. For the record, Jonathan took Masters from Shane and Alistair, while Brent took DD2 from Nicholas, Riley and Reval. Troy Snyman left his pursuers to fight over the scraps in Senior Max as Jonathan took his chain drive kart out to hold Hannah Daniel and Jandré Nel off for second. Dhivyen Naidoo beat first heat winner Uzair Khan two races to one in an entertaining high school Junior Max bout ahead of Jonno Wilson, who stole second in the final, Travis Yeld and Maahir Wahab. Travis Mingay topped the primary school action with a two race to one victory over Kyle Spies to take under 13 Mini Max. Troy Pieterse overcame a tight duel with Sebastian Geldenhuys and Cape visitor Keagan Beaumont for third. Kid brother Aiden Beaumont was the only Micro Max lad out as he studied iDube’s lines. The next Rotax Max regional is a Cape round at Killarney this Saturday, May 28 before a Formula K Gauteng round on June 4 and the Formula K National on June 25 and 26. Source: MotorsportMedia
