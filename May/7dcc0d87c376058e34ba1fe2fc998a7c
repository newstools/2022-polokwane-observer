POLOKWANE – New school uniforms, toiletries and cosmetic and sanitary items were presented to indigent learners of Kabelo Primary School in Seshego on May 19. The donation was made possible by the organisers of the Sipho Talane Golf Invitational, who took it upon themselves to raise money after the golf day. According to golfer and leader of the organisers Matsobane Tleane, they saw a need after their recent visit to the school. “With the help of the teachers at the school, we were able to identify the learners in need.”  Talane said they are happy to contribute and touch the lives of the less privileged learners at the school. “The learners reminded me of my upbringing as we did not have much at home, I went to a boarding school and I used to share a facecloth with my classmates. The situation did not deter me as I studied hard to achieve my goals. My message to these learners is that their circumstances should not be a hindrance. They should study hard to achieve their goals so that they can sustain themselves and be able to buy whatever they need. They should share the items with their families.”  Principal Tshebedi Morifi thanked the members for reaching out to their learners. “We are a school in a underprivileged community. We have learners from child-headed families and we are happy to have been in the plans of the Sipho Talane Golf Invitational. There are still many needs in the school and the gifts will go a long way in improving the lives of these learners.”
