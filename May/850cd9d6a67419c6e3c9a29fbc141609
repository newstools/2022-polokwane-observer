POLOKWANE – “I will keep this day close to my heart and please tell my kids I love them.” These were the words of former Noordskool principal Attie Visagie at the opening of the Attie Visagie Hall, a lifetime gift bestowed upon him at a surprise ceremony at the school on Friday (May 20). Visagie was principal of the school for 22 years and acting principal Bushy le Roux said it was only befitting to honour the work and legacy Visagie leaves behind him. “This school is where it is and what it is today because of you. In a School Governing Body (SGB) meeting we decided to honour you in a befitting way and as of today, the school hall will be known as the Attie Visagie Hall,” le Roux said.
