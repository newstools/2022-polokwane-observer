POLOKWANE – “We love you,” said Charlotte Joubert, the coordinator of a knitting club at the Koraal Aftreeoord, to the beneficiaries of their generous donations made with love. This message was relayed during the handover of warm beanies, ponchos and prayer dolls to Cansa TLC, which took place on May 9. Joubert added that she hopes the children who receive the donation will enjoy it and keep warm. Bobby Were, who is the coordinator at the TLC ward, said the donation is tremendously helpful and has a lot of meaning for them, especially with the recent weather patterns. “The donation came at the right time with the cold weather we’ve been experiencing. We thank the ladies for all their efforts to knit these items for the children because one of the side effects of cancer is easily feeling cold,” he said. Were added the prayer dolls, which will go to some of the children undergoing chemotherapy, will show people out there think about them and they are not alone and that means a lot to them and their parents. Joubert explained they initially started the knitting club to help one of the ladies who had a problem with knitting patterns. They formalised the group into meeting on Monday mornings from 09:00 to 12:00 and anyone who is interested to join the ladies is free to do so. “Not all the ladies live here at the Koraal, some of them come her for the knitting and live in town,” she said and added they don’t only meet up for crocheting, but they keep each other company and create close bonds. Joubert requested people’s assistance to continue knitting by making donations of wool and stuffing for the dolls.
