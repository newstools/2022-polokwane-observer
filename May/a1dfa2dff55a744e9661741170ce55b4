POLOKWANE – Held on May 12 at the N.G. Kerk Pietersburg, the Eisteddfod created a great opportunity for dancers to showcase their talent and creativity. Dancers as young as six years old, took to the stage to impress guest judge Ignatius van Heerden, who is an award-winning dancer and choreographer who has won various awards. Van Heerden explained that when he adjudicates, he looks at technique as dancers need to understand their bodies and how to use them in order to portray the story on stage. “We look at how they use their feet, how they activate their turnout, how their arms move from the upper back or are they moving from the shoulder. Is there core balance and do they understand how to coordinate their limbs? We also look for artistic expression because dance is an art at the end of the day,” he said. He added that it was lovely to see that the dancers have a good foundation of skills and knowledge, especially in the young ones. Rachelle Brunette, the Eisteddfod organiser and owner of Dancing with Chelle, said she was proud of the dancers for going on stage and giving their best. “For the future, I want them to embrace this moment to perform because I know that it doesn’t always happen in the small towns,” she said. Brunette gave thanks to Kings Castle for accommodating Van Heerden and Blossoms Gifts & Decor for the catering.
