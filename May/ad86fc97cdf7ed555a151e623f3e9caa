MOKOPANE – Over the past few years, Bosveld has repeatedly reported on the tall grass and the lack of maintenance at the local cemetery, that has now resulted in residents taking matters into their own hands. Family members recently took the responsibility to clean the graves themselves while others use private contractors and gardeners to cut the grass and clean the area where their loved ones lay buried. Community Service’s portfolio member and DA councillor, Yolande Coetzee, said a recent visit to the area caused great concern.

While some of the brush cutters are in urgent need of maintenance, others are simply missing, she added. “There is simply not enough equipment to cover the workload.” She added that the municipality has submitted orders for the much-needed repairs and material, but has not yet received any stock. Nomsa Muzondo, a private gardener contracted by a family, told Bosveld she even helps other families to clean the sites of their loved ones, in her spare time. Touch of Helping Grace has also made its services available to residents who feel they need help in cleaning and maintaining the graves. While the acting municipal manager, Hendrik Ngoepe, told Bosveld he was not aware of the situation, community services manager Refilwe Madisha said she could not comment on the complaints.
