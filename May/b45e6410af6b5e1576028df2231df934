POLOKWANE – The marathon will take place at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on June 4, and athletes can run either 42.2km (R250), 21.1km (R170) or 10km (R100). A 5km fun run at R50 per entry will be open for leisure runners as well as families. Manual entries will open on June 1 and 2 at the Polokwane Athletic Club’s clubhouse from 09:00 to 17:30. Manual entries can also be done at the clubhouse on June 3 from 09:00 at an additional R10 per entry. Race numbers can be collected on June 3 from 09:00 to 20:00 at the clubhouse, and on June 4 prior to the race. CDM Mayor Mamedupi Teffo wished all athletes a healthy and incident-free race. “The marathon has proven to be an example of how a sporting event can promote our district as well as contribute to rebuilding our local economic development in respect of our rich tourism offers for residents and visitors. The aim is to enhance and promote social cohesion, promote nation building and a national identity, and to encourage living a healthy lifestyle.” She said they expect international and national athletes to take part. “These include acclaimed runners from Africa who won in the past editions. Athletes can either belong to an affiliated club or purchase temporary licences at R40 each. The Polokwane Athletic Club will coordinate this massive race. Our main sponsor is MTN and the first 1 000 online entries in the events, except the 5km, will receive a complimentary event T-shirt.” Teffo said the winner of the 42.2km will walk away with R6 000. Polokwane Athletic Club chairperson Corrie Calitz said they are excited to be part of the event. “All systems are ready and we look forward to a great marathon. We encourage all athletes to register, either online or manually, where we will assist them at the club.”
