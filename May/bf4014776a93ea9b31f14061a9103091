Is it really necessary to feed a cold and starve a fever? We explore what you should (and shouldn’t) do if your child’s temperature rises. When your child spikes a fever and appears to be in pain, it’s natural for even the calmest moms and dads to panic. However, not all fevers are bad for children. Fever is defined as a body temperature of > (more than/equal to) 38 degrees C. As strange as it may seem, fevers can be a good thing. A fever is your child’s body’s way of fighting off infections and helping speed up recovery. Viral infections are common in infants and children, and most are not serious, including the common cold and a sore throat. Teething can be uncomfortable for young children as the tooth cuts through the gums, while in older children, cavities may also cause toothache. Childhood vaccinations can also cause fever and local reaction (pain, swelling and redness). If the temperature is light and the child appears to be in good health, you may decide to let the fever run its course. To help ease pain and stabilise your child’s temperature, speak to your local pharmacist about over-the-counter pain and fever medications suitable for your child’s age. Children with fever may be less hungry than usual but provide a nutritious, well-balanced meal when they want to eat. Well-fed children may be better able to fight illnesses. Take these three criteria into account before calling the doctor.
