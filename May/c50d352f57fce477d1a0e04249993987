This fundamental exercise doubles as an art project and a science experiment. Children get to watch a scientific phenomenon called chromatography in action while making some lovely coffee filter art! Chromatography is the separation of a mixture (for example, marker ink) by passing it through a medium (for example, a coffee filter) in which the components of the mixture (for example, the numerous colours that make up any given marker colour) flow at different rates. Top tip: Use a small amount of water rather than completely soaking the coffee filters.
