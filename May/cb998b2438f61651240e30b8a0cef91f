The new Suzuki Baleno is soon to hit South African shores and will boasts a heads-up display, 9” infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, climate control, and up to six airbags to the segment. Suzuki is one of the fastest-growing vehicle brands in South Africa, thanks in part to its exceptional customer service – as recognised in the Cars.co.za Consumer Awards and various industry competitions – and its range of value-for-money products that prove that you do not have to sacrifice quality, or luxury, when buying an affordable family car, 4×4 or workhorse. More info about the Baleno is to be released closer to the local launch.
