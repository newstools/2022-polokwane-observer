Rakgoale has described the incident as ‘inhumane and horrific’ and said it puts the safety of children in the spotlight. “May 29 will mark the start of National Child Protection Week. The week is observed to raise awareness on the rights of children as articulated in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa and specifically the Children’s Act (Act No. 38 of 2005). Society as whole must self-introspect on how it treats children,” she said. Rakgoale added that society must ensure that children are always protected. “The discovery of the child’s mutilated body dumped along a busy road says that we still have people who have a total disregard for the law and for human lives. We urge anyone with information as to the identity of the toddler as well as the crime committed, to come forward and inform the police, for justice to prevail,” she said.
