It’s tempting to make deals with your kids in order for them to finish what’s on their plate (if you don’t eat all your dinner, you won’t get dessert). Or, at the very least, force them to consume more than three bites. After all, how else will they get all the nutrition they need to grow up healthy and strong? It’s understandable for parents to want their children to eat the right amount of food daily. However, earlier generations’ “clean your plate” mindset must be abandoned. Before we get into HOW to avoid the “Clean Plate Club“, let’s talk about WHY you shouldn’t insist your kids complete their meals. It robs children of their intuitive eating abilities: Forcing your children to eat ignores their hunger and fullness indicators. Intuitive eating helps your child recognise when they are hungry and full so that they may build a healthy relationship with food. If finishing eating is a requirement for other activities — screen time, playing, dessert – it establishes an odd relationship with food. Food becomes another achievement or indicator of success for children.
