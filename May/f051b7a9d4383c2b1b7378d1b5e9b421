POLOKWANE – Their inspiration came from the residents of ward 23, Annadale, who decided to become the change they wanted to see. The clean-up was initiated by the JAMM team, which consists of Jacky Kubbanek, André Kotze, Mabotse Mothiba and Martie Bold, who decided to take a stand and bring change to the community. The team was nominated by the community to act as spokespersons between the community and municipality. Bold explained they had various meetings with the municipality to find a workable solution to the challenges the community is facing. “As JAMM, we decided our community needs something to stand together for again and make our Ladanna a cleaner, safer place,” she said. She added that in an effort to keep their community clean, they have taken to driving out on Mondays, which is their refuse collection days, to educate the recycle material collectors on what is expected of them. “Their attitude was amazing because we expected them to be negative, but we were pleasantly surprised. They listened to what was said and started to do what they were taught,” she added. JAMM also planted 10 trees in the park as a reminder of the community clean-up day. They sweetened the deal with a prize draw for the community members who took part in the initiative. Bold gave a heartfelt thank you to all the sponsors who donated the prizes and helped make the day a success. At the end of the day, a total of 58 prizes and vouchers were handed out that totalled to the value of R8 150. Altogether, 2 300 bags of refuse were collected. Ladanna residents are invited to become part of the WhatsApp group that was created with the aim to offer a platform for communication.
