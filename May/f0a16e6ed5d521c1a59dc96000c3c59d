POLOKWANE – Limpopo Softball Association (LSA) players Kwena Nkune, Lucas Lamola, Kagiso Aphane, Ronaldo Kekana and Kamogelo Makolomakwe will represent the country at the u/23 Softball World Cup. The players’ selection for the showpiece to be held in Argentina in October, came after they were impressive during the annual provincial championships which was held at Turf Hall Stadium in Cape Town in March.

Makolomakwe, whose commanding presence at the focal point, is the more experienced and will be expected to provide the catalyst for match-winning exploits. The utility player is reliable to both the offensive and defensive line-up and will add value under the guidance of coach Samson Rakgoale. Rakgoale said the selection of every player is an immense responsibility and far greater than club or provincial responsibility. LSA executive member Benny Boshomane wished the players the best of luck at the event. “They have done well in the local and national events and their inclusion in the national team validates their efforts and commitment to the game.”
