After more than 30 years of service as one of the Navy’s top aviators, Pete “Maverick” Mitchell is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him. Training a detachment of graduates for a special assignment, Maverick must confront the ghosts of his past and his deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who choose to fly it. Top Gun: Maverick is now showing at a cinema near you.  Kedibone is a poor, beautiful girl from the township and an aspiring actress. Her devoted boyfriend has put himself in debt to pay for her tertiary education. But while she is studying in Johannesburg, she starts to attract attention from rich hunks, celebrities and businessmen who promise her the affluent life she has always desired. What he doesn’t know won’t hurt him, surely? Can Kedibone live a double life and enjoy the best of both worlds? Watch Kedibone on Netflix.  As teenagers, kung fu disciples Danny, Hing and Jim were inseparable. Fast forward 25 years and each has grown into a washed-up middle-aged man seemingly one kick away from pulling a hamstring — and not at all preoccupied with thoughts of martial arts or childhood best friends. But when their old master is murdered, the trio reunites, soon learning that avenging their Sifu will require conquering old grudges (and a dangerous hitman still armed with ample knee cartilage) if they are to honourably defend his legacy.
